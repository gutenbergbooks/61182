<hr class="r15" />

<p>The history of the <i>Seven Wise Masters</i> forms an important epoch in
the history of European popular stories, because it affords the most
remarkable evidence of the literary descent and origin of stories,
as distinct from a traditional descent. Professor Comparetti in
his <cite>Researches respecting the Book of Sindibad</cite>, published by the
Folk-Lore Society, Mr. Clouston in his <cite>Bakhtyar Nama</cite> and in his
<cite>Book of Sindibad</cite>, two privately printed books, and Mr. Wright in his
<cite>Sevyn Sages</cite>, printed by the Percy Society in 1846, have practically
exhausted the literary history of this famous collection of stories.
Shortly summarised from these three sources the main facts are these.
There was an ancient original Indian book of stories which became so
popular that it was copied frequently, and thus handed down from one
generation to another. From this book two separate groups of texts have
descended. To the first belong all the texts in the Eastern languages;
to the other belong the <cite>Dolopathos</cite>, the <cite>Historia Septem Sapientum</cite>,
the <cite>Erasto</cite>, and other numerous texts of the various European
literatures of the Middle Ages. With the Eastern group of texts we have
now

<span class="pagenum">[Pg ii]</span>

nothing to do beyond saying that Professor Comparetti has restored, in
the scholarly book above mentioned, the form of the original text for
the guidance of the modern student. The Western group of texts has a
history of its own quite apart from its Eastern origin. It has kept the
original framework, but it has varied the setting; and this variation
will be found of great interest to the student of popular tradition.
Before, however, we come to this part of the subject, let us see the
kind of work with which we are dealing. The framework of the romance is
as follows: A young prince, falsely accused by the wife of the king,
his father, of having attempted to offer her violence, is defended
by seven sages, who relate a series of stories to show the deceits
of women, the queen at the same time urging the death of the accused
prince by the example of stories told by herself. This system of
story-telling is practically the same as that adopted in the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>. Boccaccio adopted this plan in his <cite>Decameron</cite>; Chaucer
adopted it in his <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>.</p>

<p>Among the Eastern texts is a famous one in Hebrew, dating as far
back as the first half of the thirteenth century. Under the title of
<cite>Historia Septem Sapientum Romæ</cite>, a Latin translation of this was made
by Dam Jehans, a monk of the abbey of Haute Selve, in the diocese of
Nancy, in the thirteenth century. The earliest printed copy of this
version that I have been able to find is one printed at Cologne in
1490, of which I shall say something a little further on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg iii]</span></p>

<p>It was through this Latin version that the work was communicated to
nearly all the languages of Western Europe; and in 1520 a translation
into English was printed by the famous printer Wynkyn de Worde. A fine
copy of this is preserved in the British Museum, and from it is printed
the text of the present version. One or two pages are missing from
this copy, and the passages are restored from the earliest chap-book
version which I have been able to discover&mdash;namely, that printed
in 1671 at London, and belonging to the British Museum. This chap-book
version is nearly identical with the Wynkyn de Worde, with the simple
alteration of the spelling to the modern forms. One curious variation,
however, illustrating the force of the change of religious opinions
at the time of the Reformation, is well worth noting. On page 173
of our text will be found related how the murdered children of the
Emperor Lodwyke were found alive singing "of ye moost
blessed vyrgyne Mary, aue Maria gracia plena dn&#772;s tecum," but
in the chap-book of 1671 it is said they were singing praises to the
Almighty.</p>

<p>Since 1671 many chap-book versions have been issued, and I have
succeeded in obtaining a copy still published in Dublin. These later
versions are all much deteriorated from the original. Besides the 1671
edition, there are the following: London 1684, 1687, and 1697; Glasgow
1713; London [1750]; Newcastle 1750; London 1780—7 [1785]; Boston 1794;
London 1805; Warrington 1815. And I have no

<span class="pagenum">[Pg iv]</span>

doubt that it has been continually reproduced until the present day.</p>

<p>Besides the closeness of the translation of the prose version of
Wynkyn de Worde, one curious feature to be noted is the series of
illustrations. It is well known that German woodcuts supplied English
books with illustrations,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and this is a good instance of the practice. In the <cite>Bibliographer</cite> (vol. ii. p. 70)
Mr. W. M. Conway has told the history of the woodcuts of the Lubeck edition of the <cite>Seven
Wise Men</cite>. It was first printed in April, 1488,
with the name of Claes Leeu, probably a brother of Gerard Leeu. In 1490
appeared another edition printed at Cologne by J. Koelhof de Lubeck,
to whom the blocks must have been lent. He returned them to Leeu with
the exception of one, which was either retained by him or lost on the
journey; and the imperfect set, a new block being made by some other
hand to replace the lost one, was employed in the edition printed by
Leeu on the 6th November, 1490. One of the cuts (see p. 21) represents
the Emperor coming angrily into the chamber of his wife with a drawn
sword in his hand and reproaching her with her infidelity. She is
seated on a chair on the right, with her hands clasped in an attitude
rather of shyness than fear or remorse. One reason for this seems to be
discoverable from the fact that along the top of the bed behind, the
words <i>Ave regina c&oelig;lorum</i> can be traced carved in reverse; and
it is quite possible that the whole cut, with the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg v]</span>

exception of the figure of the Emperor, was copied from some print
representing the Annunciation.</p>

<p>Both these editions, that by J. Koelhof de Lubeck and that printed
by Gerard Leeu on 6th November, 1490, are in the library of the British
Museum, the latter under the title of <cite>Historia de Calumnia Novercali</cite>.
This book has a preface not contained in the other edition, and it
formed the subject of a communication to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for
1767, p. 541, in a letter signed T. From this letter it would appear
that later editions were issued. The preface quoted in the letter is
the same as the preface in the British Museum copy, but the words of
the latter are much more contracted than the writer in the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite> indicates was the case with his copy. This letter is, I
think, worth reproducing, as it conveys some useful information. It is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I lately met with a mutilated copy of a book, which to me, at
least, appears a curiosity. It bears for its title, <cite>Historia de
Calumnia Novercali</cite>: an history now commonly sold at stalls for the
entertainment of English children, under the title of <cite>The History of
the Seven Wise Masters</cite>; with which last-mentioned book mine agrees as
to the substance and order of the tales, but differs considerably from
it in the form and manner of relating them.</p>

<p>"It is printed in sixteens, in the common Gothic character of the
time (the beginning, as I judge, of the 16th century), an <i>English</i> or
<i>black</i> face approaching to a <i>Roman</i>, on a <i>pica</i> body,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>

and with many abbreviations, and is ornamented with wooden cuts of
the size of the pages, which, considering their age, are by no means
contemptible.</p>

<p>"The preface runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Compositâ pridem <i>Calumniæ Novercalis Historia</i> quæ <i>Septem
Sapientum</i> dicitur, pulchro quidem argumento, pulchris etiam ac
memoratu dignis tractata exemplis, in utramq: partem &amp; defensionis
&amp; condemnationis sive vera sive ficta sit, nihil ad te attinere
puto mi <i>Gerarde</i>: magis autem quid doceat adverte, intelligimus ex
ea &amp; qui sint malarum mulierum, &amp; pravorum liberorum, &amp;
zelotyporum itemq: delirorum senum aliarumq: personarum mores atq:
fortunæ variâ ratione, ut quid caveri quidve eligi oporteat agnoscamus.
Cum autam nominum quorundam ratio temporibus satis respondere visa
non esset, &amp; textus nimium fluxus minimeq: cohærens videretur
non indignum judicavi quo tibi morem gererem id postulanti, paululum
mutatis verbis obmissisq: nominibus ne legentem offendant, re ipsa
integra servata, hanc narationem efferre; ne quid inventori laudis aut
inventioni veritatis detractum esse videatur: imposito potius nomine
<i>Calumniæ Novercalis</i> qualis &amp; Phædræ fuit is Hyppolitum; et simili
quoq: genere uxoris Putipharis in Joseph Hebræum; &amp; senum illorum
in Susannam; ut eo nomine historia hæc majorem notitiam gratiamq: apud
lectores sit habitura.'</p>

<p>"From hence it appears that this book is an alteration and
improvement of a more ancient work, intitled <cite>Historia Septem</cite>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span>

<cite>Sapientum</cite>, and, as the particulars here said to be altered are
retained unaltered in the English translation, it should seem
that the English history is translated from a performance of a
more early date than this."</p>

<p>The woodcuts of the Wynkyn de Worde are not identical
with the Cologne edition, but copies, having been decidedly
improved. All these are reproduced in facsimile in the present
edition. Owing to the missing pages, one or two of these
illustrations are not given in the British Museum copy. The
Cologne edition contains a frontispiece plate, one after the first
two as printed on pages 4 and 8 of our text, and two printed
at the end of the book, making four in all, which are not contained
in the British Museum copy of the Wynkyn de Worde.</p>

<p>We will now consider the stories given in this version of the
<i>Seven Wise Masters</i>. Although the framework, as I have
pointed out, is ancient, the setting has been altered. The
stories that suited Eastern fancy did not suit Western; and
accordingly we have a considerable variation. In order to have
the stories clearly before us, the following analysis will be found
useful:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) <i>The first example of the Empress.</i>&mdash;In the garden of a
Roman burgess was a tree famed for its cure of all diseases&mdash;the
burgess one day discovered a "fair young imp"&mdash;this was
planted and put under the care of the gardener&mdash;the young tree
did not flourish&mdash;the burgess commanded the branches of the
overshading old tree to be cut down to the ground&mdash;the young

<span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span>

tree then did not flourish&mdash;the burgess commanded the old tree
to be cut down to the ground&mdash;the young tree died.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>The example of the first Master.</i>&mdash;A knight had one son&mdash;also
a greyhound and a falcon&mdash;the knight went to a tourney&mdash;a
serpent in the hall attacked the child&mdash;the falcon roused
the attention of the greyhound&mdash;the greyhound fought the
serpent and killed it&mdash;the greyhound, wounded, went and laid
down by the cradle of the child, which became covered with
his blood&mdash;the nurses coming in thought the child was killed by
the greyhound&mdash;they tell their mistress, who tells the knight&mdash;the
knight kills the greyhound&mdash;he afterwards discovers his
error and repents.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>The second example of the Empress.</i>&mdash;An Emperor had a
forest in which was a boar that destroyed all men going through
the forest&mdash;the Emperor proclaimed that whoever should slay
the boar should marry his daughter&mdash;a shepherd by stratagem
slew the boar, and married the daughter.</p>

<p>(4.) <i>The example of the second Master.</i>&mdash;In a city there was
an ancient knight who had married a young wife&mdash;there was a
law or custom in that city that whoever was found in the streets
after the ringing of a certain bell should be put in the pillory&mdash;the
wife had a paramour, and every night she went to her lover.
One night the husband woke and missed his wife, and on her
return would not let her in&mdash;she went to the well and pretended
to drown herself&mdash;the husband came out of the house to help
his wife out of the well&mdash;she then ran into the house and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg ix]</span>

locked the doors, and her husband being found in the streets by
the watch, was taken to prison and on the morrow put in the
pillory.</p>

<p>(5.) <i>The third complaint of the Empress.</i>&mdash;There was in
Rome a knight that had two daughters and one son&mdash;the
knight, by hunting and tournaments, spent all his substance.
There was an emperor at that time who had a tower full of
gold&mdash;the knight and his son agreed to steal some of the gold&mdash;the
keeper of the tower put a vessel full of pitch that the
robber might fall in&mdash;the second time the knight and his son
went the knight fell into the pitch&mdash;the son cut off the father's
head and hid it, that the body should not be recognized&mdash;the
daughters of the knight made a great outcry on seeing their
father's body dragged through the streets&mdash;the son then wounded
himself, and the officers believed his story that it was on account
of his wound that his sisters made lamentations.</p>

<p>(6.) <i>The example of the third Master.</i>&mdash;There was a rich
burgess that had a "pie" which he loved and taught to speak&mdash;his
wife had a lover who visited her in the absence of the burgess&mdash;the
pie threatened to tell the burgess&mdash;the wife imitated rain
and hail and snow on the bird's cage and nearly killed her&mdash;when
the burgess returned the pie told him that his wife's
lover had stayed all night with her, and that the hail, rain, and
snow that night had nearly killed him&mdash;the master hearing
that the night had been quite fine, killed the bird, thinking it
had told lies&mdash;he afterwards found out the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg x]</span></p>

<p>(7.) <i>The fourth example of the Empress.</i>&mdash;There were once
seven wise masters who governed Rome under an Emperor,
who by their artifices they made blind whenever he left the
palace&mdash;the Emperor, on pain of death, desired the seven wise
masters to cure him&mdash;the masters discover a child who shewed
the meaning of dreams&mdash;they brought him to the Emperor&mdash;the
child discovered in the Emperor's bedchamber a well which
had seven springs&mdash;the child commanded the wise masters to
be killed, one at a time, and thrown into the well&mdash;the well
and springs vanished.</p>

<p>(8.) <i>The example of the fourth Master.</i>&mdash;There was an old
knight who married a young wife&mdash;the wife wished to have a
lover, but on the persuasion of her mother tried the knight
three times: 1st, by cutting down a favourite tree&mdash;2nd, by
killing a favourite hound&mdash;3rd, by destroying everything on the
table at a banquet. The two first the knight forgave, the third
time he brought a barber who opened veins in the wife's arms&mdash;the
wife thereupon said she would be content with her husband.</p>

<p>(9.) <i>The fifth example of the Empress.</i>&mdash;There reigned in
Rome an Emperor who was covetous and loved gold above all
things.&mdash;In the city was a wise master who made a tower, and
in it as many images as there were provinces governed by Rome,
and when there was any rebellion or dispute in these distant
provinces the images rang a bell, and so informed the people.
The kings of these provinces consulted together how best to
defeat Rome. Four knights undertook to get the images

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xi]</span>

and tower destroyed if they could have four tons of gold&mdash;they
took this and went to Rome&mdash;and represented themselves as
soothsayers, and pretended to discover by dreams quantities
of gold which they had previously hidden&mdash;they obtained permission
of the Emperor to dig under the tower for more gold&mdash;undermined
the tower and rode away&mdash;the counsellors of the
Emperor put him to death for betraying the image to their
enemies.</p>

<p>(10.) <i>The example of the fifth Master.</i>&mdash;There was a famous
physician named Ypocras&mdash;he had a nephew named Galienus,
who in time excelled Ypocras&mdash;the king of Ungary sent for
Ypocras to cure his son&mdash;Ypocras sent Galienus instead&mdash;Galienus
on seeing the sick child said to the queen that the
king was not its father, and demanded to know who was&mdash;the
queen told him the truth and Galienus cured the child.
Ypocras on hearing from Galienus that he had cured the child
killed him by craft&mdash;Ypocras was taken grievously sick, and
his scholars and disciples were unable to heal him&mdash;He knew
that for the death of Galienus he was made sick&mdash;confessed
from envy he had slain him, and died.</p>

<p>(11.) <i>The sixth example of the Empress.</i>&mdash;There was a king
marvellously deformed in his visage so that women hated and
abhorred him&mdash;the king desired his steward to bring a fair and
beauteous woman, and promised a large sum of money to the
woman&mdash;the steward from covetousness insisted on his own
wife going to the king and thus obtaining the money&mdash;the king

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xii]</span>

found out that the steward had undone his own wife, banished
him on pain of death and kept the wife. The king assembled
a great army to conquer Rome, but by the stratagems of seven
wise masters there was defeated with great slaughter and killed.</p>

<p>(12.) <i>The example of the sixth Master.</i>&mdash;There was an
emperor of Rome who had three knights whom he loved above
all others. There was also in the city an ancient knight who
had a fair young wife&mdash;this wife would sit at her window looking
into the street and sing. The three knights at different
times passed her window and fell in love with her&mdash;they each
offered her a hundred florins&mdash;she consented to receive them,
promising to send for them on a suitable opportunity. She told
her husband, and suggested that when the knights came he
should kill them and keep the hundred florins&mdash;the husband
consented and killed each of the knights&mdash;the wife got her
brother to dispose of the first body, and by telling him the corpse
had come back again, of the other two&mdash;the husband afterwards
quarrelled with his wife and struck her&mdash;she in revenge told
how he had murdered the three knights&mdash;they were both drawn
at a horse's tail and hanged.</p>

<p>(13.) <i>The seventh example of the Empress.</i>&mdash;A king loved his
wife above all things and locked her up alwayes in a strong
castle and kept the keys himself. A knight in distant parts
dreamed of a fair queen whose love he would win&mdash;the queen
dreamt the same night of the knight&mdash;the knight travelled
about till he came to the queen's tower, and knew her for the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xiii]</span>

lady of his dream.&mdash;He entered the king's service&mdash;fought
bravely, was made the king's steward, and gained permission of
the king to build a place adjoining the castle&mdash;He built a secret
passage to the queen's rooms&mdash;gained her love&mdash;she gave him a
ring the king had given her&mdash;the king saw the ring on the
knight's hand and demanded of the queen the ring he had given
her&mdash;she showed it to the king having previously got it back
from the knight&mdash;the knight asked the king to be present at a
banquet at which would be his lady love&mdash;presented the queen
to the king as a lady of his own country&mdash;the king after the
banquet went to the queen's rooms, found her there, and thought
he had been mistaken a second time&mdash;the knight asked the
king to be present at his wedding and to give the bride away&mdash;the
king gave the queen to the knight and saw them sail away
from the city&mdash;went back to the castle and found out how he
had been deceived.</p>

<p>(14.) <i>The example of the seventh Master.</i>&mdash;A knight had a
fair young wife whom he tenderly loved&mdash;one day she cut her
hand and the sight of her blood killed her husband&mdash;she
bewailed his death greatly&mdash;would not leave the grave&mdash;her
friends made a little house close by where she might stay and
get food. When a trespasser against the law was hanged the
sheriff was obliged to watch all night by the gallows, and if the
body was stolen the sheriff had to lose his land and his life.
It happened soon after that a man was hanged, and the sheriff
watched by the gallows&mdash;he saw the little house, asked permission

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xiv]</span>

to enter to warm himself&mdash;the sheriff went back to the
gallows and found the body stolen&mdash;told the lady, who advised
him, if he would marry her, to take up her dead husband and
hang him on the gallows in place of the thief&mdash;when the body
was dug up, the sheriff said he could not hang her husband
up as he was, the thief having lost two front teeth, his ears, and
was otherwise mutilated&mdash;the lady mutilated her husband in a
corresponding manner&mdash;she reminded the sheriff of his promise
to marry her&mdash;he refused, and killed her.</p>

<p>(15.) <i>The example of Dioclesian, the King's son.</i>&mdash;A knight
had one son, who was sent away to learn, and returned well
favoured&mdash;as they sat at table a nightingale sang&mdash;the son
interpreted the song to mean that he should become great and
be waited upon by his father and mother&mdash;the knight was
angered, and cast his son into the sea&mdash;the son swam to land,
from which he was rescued by a ship&mdash;the shipmen sold him
to a duke&mdash;the duke took him into favour&mdash;the king of the
country (Egypt) summoned his council to tell him why ravens
followed him wherever he went, and promised to give his
daughter to him who would interpret the event&mdash;the child, who
went with the duke, interpreted the event, and the ravens left
the country&mdash;the king thereupon took the child, Alexander, to
live with him&mdash;before marrying his daughter, Alexander asked
leave to visit the court of Titus&mdash;leave was granted, and he
went and was much loved&mdash;there came also the son of the King
of France, Lodwyke&mdash;the two, Lodwyke and Alexander, were

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xv]</span>

much alike&mdash;the emperor had a daughter whom Lodwyke fell
in love with&mdash;Alexander used to attend her&mdash;she fell in love
with him&mdash;he, however, allowed Lodwyke to attend her in his

<p>Of these fifteen stories only three are the same as those
given in the <cite>Book of Sindibad</cite>, as published by Professor Comparetti&mdash;namely,
No. 2, the example of the first Master, which
is told by the fifth Master in the Sindibad version; No. 6, the
example of the third Master, which is told by the first Master
of the Sindibad version; and No. 11, the sixth example of the
Empress, which is told by the fourth Master of the Sindibad
version. No. 3, the second example of the Empress, may
perhaps be a variant of the fifth example of the Empress in the
Sindibad version. The remaining stories then might, <i>prima facie</i>,
be considered of Western origin; and perhaps genuine Folk-Tales
thus early enshrined in literature. No. 4 is to be found
in Peter Alfonsi's <cite>Disciplina Clericalis</cite> and in the Decameron.
And Mr. Wright, in his Introduction to The <cite>Seuyn Sages</cite> (Percy

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xvii]</span>

Society), p. liii. says he heard the same story told traditionally
in an English country town of a townsman who had a scolding
unruly wife. No. 5 is a variant of the legend of Rhampsinitus,
king of Egypt, as told by Herodotus; and a similar legend is
given in Pausanias, lib. ix. c. 37. No. 7 contains some of the
incidents of Merlin's story told by the Chroniclers. No. 10,
the example of the fifth Master, is something like Campbell's
"Fearachur Leigh," No. xlvii. of his <i>Highland Stories</i> (vol. ii.
p. 161). No. 13 bears an analogy to the plot of the <cite>Miles
Gloriosus</cite> of Plautus. Upon the entire question of the occurrence
elsewhere of these stories I would refer to Mr. Clouston's
<cite>Book of Sindibad</cite> privately printed in 1884.</p>

<p>There are one or two curious words and expressions which
may be of use to the philologist, but the reader will find that the
language used is mainly that of the present day with a different
spelling. Some of the difficulties of this style have been obviated
by the insertion, where necessary, of letters left out in contracted
words, and these insertions are printed in italics to
distinguish them from the original.</p>

Therupon answerde themperour, It is your counseyll that I shall take

heart, for under the sun there is no creature that I love so well as
you and therefore trust in my love.</p>

<p>[Then said the fair Empress: if it be so as you say, I require of
you, a little boon or petition. Desire what you will, said the Emperor
and all that to me is possible, I shall fulfil, and give it to you.
Then said the Empress, my dear Lord, you know I have no child yet by
you conceived for which I am sore pensive and heave; but Fame that
never conceals it self long to true joy, hath delivered this happy
truth to me; that ye have one Son only the which is sent to
the seven Wise Masters to be taught and governed, and him I hold and
require for my own son: wherefore I beseech ye send for him
that I may see him and have consolation of his presence, as though he
were mine own. Hereupon answered the Emperor it is sixteen years past
since I saw him, your will shall be fulfilled. Incontinent the Emperor
sent unto the seven wise Masters a Letter sealed with his secret Sign,
that upon pain of death they should bring his son in the feast of
Penticost following.</p>

Emperor's<br /> letter would first observe the course and divine for
shewing<br /> of the Firmament, and Planets, whether it were good to<br
/> obey his commandment or not. </h2>

<p>[And when the Masters by the letter had understood the Emperors will
in the night they went and beheld the stars in the Firmament, whether
it would be expedient to bring the child to the Emperor or not? and
they saw clearly in the stars, that if they should lead the child in
that time assigned, at the first word he should speak he should die
an evil death: wherefore they were all very sorry; and as they beheld
another star, they saw, that if they delivered not the child at the day
aforesaid, they should lose their heads. Then said one of them of two
evils the least is to be chosen: it is better that all we die, than
that the child should lose his life: therefore that we may save the
childs life let us go to the Emperor. And as they were thus sorrowful,
the child came down from his chamber, and seeing his Masters so heavy,
he demanded the cause of their heaviness: whereunto they answered: Sir,
we have received your Fathers Letters that upon pain of death, now this
high

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>

feast of Penticost we shall lead you to your countrey, whereupon we
have beholden the firmament, wherein we clearly find, that if we
(within the time prefixed) present you to your father, at the first
word that y<sup>e</sup> shall pronounce out of your mouth ye shall be
to the most vilest death condemned. Then said the child, I must also
behold the Firmament with the stars: and so he did; and found clear
in a little star, that if he could abstain from speaking seven dayes,
he should be preserved and save his life. And after he had seen this,
he call'd his Masters and shewed them the star, and said Behold my
dear Masters, I see perfectly in the star, that if I abstain myself
seven daies, I shall save my life. Ye are now seven Masters, the
wisest of all the world, it is an easie thing for you, every of you
for me one day to answer and with your wise answer every of you his
day, my life may save and keep; and in the eighth day I shall speak
my self, and save my life and all you from peril. As the Masters did
behold that certain star, they thought with themselves that the child
had said truth, saying, Almighty God be thanked, that the wisdom and
cunning of our Disciple exceedeth us all. Then said the first master
Pantillus, Lord, I shall speak for you the first day, and save your
life. And Lentulus, the second master said I shall for you the second
day answer; and so consequently every of them promised to answer for
himself his day; and this said, they cloathed the child in purple,
leaped on horseback with a fair company and hasted with the child to
the Emperor.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>[In the city of Rome was a Burgess which had a fair Garden,
wherein he had a noble Tree, the which every year brought
forth fruit of good vertue for whosoever eat thereof that were
sick of any manner of sickness or leprosie he should soon be
whole and receive his sight. It happened on a day, as the Burgess
went into his garden to visit the Tree, he espied under the
Tree a fair young Imp, and called to him the Gardiner and
said: my friend, of this young Imp I give thee charge for I
trust of that to plant a better Tree than this is. The Gardiner
said: I shall it gladly do. Another time the Burgess came
again into his garden to visit the young Plant, and it appeared
unto him that it grew not so much as it should do, and he said
to the Gardiner: how may this be and he said, it is no wonder,
for this great Tree hath so great arms and branches, that the
air may not come to the root of the young tree, then said the
Burgess, cut and hew off the arms and the boughs, that the air
may come thereto. The Gardiner did as he commanded. The

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>

Burgess came again another time to see the young plant, and
thought that it grew never the better and said to the Gardiner,
what is it that letteth this plant not to grow now: and he said,
I suppose the height of the Old Tree letteth the Sun, that
the rain may not come thereto, and therefore it cannot grow.
Then said the Master unto him, hew down that tree to the
ground, for I hope of this Plant to have a better than ever] this
was. The gardyner heryng his mayster obeyed hym, &#8266; hewe
downe the tree. And as this was done y<sup>t</sup> yonge plant all holy
perysshed and came to nought. wherof came grete harme, for
whan y<sup>e</sup> poore &#8266; the seke people perceyued y<sup>t</sup> the tree was so
destroyed they cursed all them that were of counseyll &#8266; helpers
therto / by the whiche they all afore tyme were heled &#8266; cured

<p>There was a valyaunt knyght whiche had oonly one soone as

his kepynge thre nourysshes, the fyrste sholde gyue hym souke
&#8266; fede hym, y<sup>e</sup>
seconde sholde wasshe hym &#8266;
kepe hym clene, y<sup>e</sup> thirde sholde brynge hym to slepe

a fawcon y<sup>t</sup> he also loued ryghte well.
The greyhounde was so good y<sup>t</sup> he neuer ran too noo game
but he toke it &#8266;
helde it tyl his mayster came. And yf his
mayster dysposed hym to go to batayle, yf he sholde not spede

that he was neuer caste of to his praye but he toke it. This
same knyght had grete plesure in iustynge &#8266;
turneynge, so y<sup>t</sup> vpon a tyme vnder his castell he lete proclame
a tornement to

the whiche came many good lordes and knyghtes. The knyght
entred in to y<sup>e</sup> tourney, &#8266;
his lady went with her maydens to se it. And as they went out after went
the nourysshes &#8266;
lefte the chylde lyenge alone in the cradell in the halle
where the greyhounde laye nygh the wall, and y<sup>e</sup> hauke or
faucon standynge vpon a perke. In this halle there was a serpente
lurkynge or hydde in a hole. to all them of the castell
vnknowen. The whiche wh&#257; felte that they were all
absent he put out his hede of his hole. &#8266;
as he noman sawe but the chylde lyenge in y<sup>e</sup> cradell, he went out of his cauerne
towardes y<sup>e</sup> cradell for the chylde to haue slayne. The noble
faucon seynge that, behelde y<sup>e</sup> grehounde that was slep&#563;ge/
she made suche a noyse &#8266;

&#8266; they
bothe faught so long togyder tyll y<sup>t</sup> the serpente hadde greuously
hurted and wounded the greyhounde that he bled sore.
soo y<sup>t</sup> the erthe about the cradell was al be bled with the blode

as they sawe the cradell reuersed with bloode vppon

they thought and sayde amonges themselfe that the greyhounde
hadde slayne the chylde, and they were not soo wyse as too
tourne vppe ayen the cradell with the chylde for too haue seene
what was therof befallen. But they sayd / lete vs fle or ren

lamentacyon. She answered hym, O my lorde youre greyhounde that ye
loue soo moche hath slayne your onely sone, &#8266;
lyeth by the wal sacyate with bloode of the chylde. The knyght hugely angred went in to

the greyhounde went to hym to mete and to fawne

with one stroke smote of the houndes heede, and went to ye
cradell and founde his sone al hole, and by the cradell the serpente
slayne. And by dyuers sygnes perceyued that the hounde

Then with grete sorowe &#8266;

</div>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>[In a City was an ancient Knight, which wedded a young wife
and fair, as ye hath done, whom he loved above all earthly
things; the knight was a very circumspect and careful husband
insomuch that every night he locked the door with his own
hands and laid the keys under his Beds-head. In that City was
a law or custom, that at a certain hour in the night, a bell was
used to be rung, that after the ringing of the said bell, if any
man or woman were by the watch-men found about the streets,
all that night they should be kept in prison, and on the morrow
set upon the Pillory, that all people might behold them.</p>

<p>[The said Knight had little lust of fleshly deeds, for he was
very old, and might not satiate or perform the desires and
appetites of his young wife; wherefore every night she having
a Paramour, her Husband sleeping, took the keys from under
his Beds-head, and went to her love; and when she came again,
laid the keys under her husband's head; and thus they played
many a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>[It happened upon a night that the knight awaked from his
sleep, and missed his wife, and the keys and his Beds-head,
whereupon he rose up and went unto the doors, and found them
open, the which he bolted fast within, and went up again into
his chamber, and looked out of the window towards the street:
and when it was near the third cocks crow, his wife came from
her best beloved, and found the door shut and bolted within:
then was she] sorowfull. neuerthelesse she knocked to haue
come in. Tho spake the knyght out of the wyndowe. O y<sup>u</sup>
moste euyll &#8266;
vnclene wyfe, now I knowe &#8266;
am experte that many a tyme ye haue forsaken my bedde
&#8266; gone and done
auoutrye. now shall ye stande tyll the bel be rongen and y<sup>t</sup> the
wakers may take you and doo with you according to the lawe.
The wyfe answered, My lorde wherfore lay ye that to me.
In trouth I shall saye you I was called by my moders mayden
&#8266; fetched in the nyght, &#8266;
whan I sawe that ye slepte so swetely
I durste not awake you bycause that ye are olde, and therfore
I toke y<sup>e</sup> keyes &#8266;
went to my moder the whyche is sore seke,
that I fere too morowe she must bee anoynted or aneeled notwithstandyng
for that I sholde not you offende or dysplease I
haue hasted me aye<i>n</i> to you &#8266;
haue lefte her lyenge in grete payne &#8266;
infyrmyte. Therfore I pray you for the loue of god lete me in afore the bel be rongen.
The knyght answered So shall ye not come in, ye muste there
abyde vnto the tyme that the bell be rongen,
&#8266;
tyll that y<sup>e</sup> wakers come and take
you. The she sayde that sholde be to you &#8266;
to me: to all our

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>

frendes &#8266; kynred a grete shame and rebuke. Therfore atte the
reuerence of almyghty god lete me come in. Than sayd he, Haue in thy
m&#563;de euil and false wyfe how oftentymes ye haue forsaken my
bedde and doone auoutrye. It is moche better that ye suffer shame and
beewayle for youre synnes here in this worlde, thanne for too suffer
payne in helle. She sayd ayen to h&#563; I praye you for the loue of
h&#563; y<sup>t</sup> was crucyfyed &#8266; dyed vpon the crosse haue
mercy vpon me. The knyght answered, ye laboure all in vayn&#772; for
ye shall not come in, but ye shall tary the comynge the wakers. As she
herde that, she sayde my lorde ye knowe well that by this dore standyth
a well, yf ye lete me not come in I shall therin drowne my selfe,
rather thanne all my frendes sholde be shamed for me. Then&#772;e sayd
he, wolde god y<sup>t</sup> ye had be drowned long afore or ye in my
bedde came. And as they thus spake togyder, y<sup>e</sup> mone went
down &#8266; was al derke. Tho sayde she, yf it wyll none otherwyse
be I shal drowne miselfe, but yet afore as a trewe crysten woman I
wylle make my testament. Fyrst I bequethe to god &#8266; to oure lady
my soule, my body too be buryed in y<sup>e</sup> chyrche of saynt
Peter &#8266; of all other th&#563;ges &#8266; goodes y<sup>t</sup>
god hath sent me, I gyue vnto you to dyspose for my soule after your
wysdome &#8266; dyscrecyon, &#8266; whan she had thus sayd, she went
to the well, &#8266; a grete stone ther beynge w<sup>t</sup> bothe her
armes she lyfte vp &#8266; sayd, Nowe I drowne myselfe, &#8266; caste
y<sup>e</sup> stone downe in to the well &#8266; went ayen pryuely and
stode by the dore. The knyghte herynge that noyse cryed w<sup>t</sup> a
lowde voyce saynge / alas alas

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>

my wyfe is drowned, and hastely came downe and r&#257;ne to the well.
And whan she sawe that the dore was open, anone she entred and locked
and made faste y<sup>e</sup> yate / &#8266; went vp to y<sup>e</sup>
chamber &#8266; laye &#8266; loked out of y<sup>e</sup> wyndowe. The
knyghte stode by y<sup>e</sup> welle &#8266; cryed and wepte bytterly
and sayd, woo be to me I haue now loste my moost beloued wyfe, cursed
be the tyme that I made faste the dore ayenst her. The lady herde that
&#8266; sayd, O ye cursed olde grysarde, why stade ye there this tyme
on y<sup>e</sup> nyght, was not my body to you suffycyent, wherfore
goo ye thus euery nyghte, out to your harlottes &#8266; hores and leue
my bed. As he herde the voyce of his wyfe he was ryght gladde and sayd
Blessed be god that yet she is not drowned. But my good lady wherfore
laye ye suche thynges ayenst me. I thoughte to haue chastysed you,
and therfore I locked the dore. But in no wyse I entended your peryl
/ ye knowe well whatte sorowe I made for you whan I herde you to haue
fallen in the well, &#8266; therfore I came lyghtly to haue holpen
you. Therupon she sayde, falsly ye lye. I neuer dyde suche thinges as
ye laye to me. But it appereth by a comyn prouerbe, he y<sup>t</sup>
is defectyfe or culpable hymself in a synne, he iugeth euery man to be
in the same, or elles y<sup>t</sup> fader soughte neuer his sone in
y<sup>e</sup> ouen: but yf he had ben therin h&#563;selfe. And therfore
ye put that to me y<sup>t</sup> ye yourselfe haue oftentymes done
&#8266; vsed but one thynge I promys you. ye shall abyde there tyll
y<sup>e</sup> wakers come, &#8266; that y<sup>e</sup> bell be rongen
that they may lede you before y<sup>e</sup> iuges to abyde &#8266;
suffer the law. Tho

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>

sayd the knyght, wherfore laye ye suche thynges too me / I
am olde &#8266;
all my lyfe dayes I haue ben conuersaunt in this cyte,
&#8266;
in this was I neuer dyffamed, [et] therfore lete me in that to
me ne to your self ye do no shame. She sayd, ye speke in
vayne, It is better that ye forthynke your s&#563;nes in this worlde
than in hell. Haue in mynde what the wyse man sayth. A
poore man proude, A ryche man a lyer, An olde man a fole
god hatyth. So ye be a lyer and ryche. what nede was it too
you for too lye vpon me. And ye are a fole, for ye had ye
floure of my youth at your pleasure, and yet ye muste renne to hoores
&#8266; harlottes.
And therfore it is a grete grace of god that ye haue tyme and space too
forthynke it, leste that ye sholde perysshe and be dampned for eurmore.
&#8266; for y<sup>t</sup>
suffre your penaunce pacyently. Tho knyght sayd, O my best and well
beloued lady all though it be so, yet is god mercyfull, and he
asketh noo thynge of a synner, but he amende his lyfe and forthynke
and doo penaunce for his synnes. Nowe lete me come
in and I wyll make amendes, She sayde, Whiche deuyll hath
made you so good a prechour, So come ye not in. And as
they thus spake the bell was rongen / y<sup>e</sup> knyght herynge that
sayd, O my mooste dere lady the bell ryngeth now, suffer me
to come in that I be not ashamed for euer. whiche answered,
y<sup>e</sup> ryng&#563;ge of the bell pretendeth the helthe of youre soule take
it pacyently in your pena&#363;ce. And as this was sayd come y<sup>e</sup>
wakers y<sup>t</sup> aboute the cyte went &#8266;
founde the knyght standynge
in y<sup>e</sup> strete &#8266;
sayd to hy<i>m</i>, O good man it is not gode y<sup>t</sup> ye

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>

in this houre of y<sup>e</sup> nyght stande here. And as she herde the
voyce of y<sup>e</sup> wakers / she sayd, Good felowes venge me on y<sup>t</sup>
olde cursed horehunter &#8266;
rybaude, for ye knowe whose doughter
and what I am. This cursed olde man is wont euery nyght
to leue my bed, &#8266;
gothe to his hoores &#8266;
harlottes. I haue longe forborne hym and wolde not shewe it ne complayne vpon
hym too my frendes, for I trusted that he wolde haue am&#275;ded
his mysrule, &#8266;
it helpeth not. And therfore take hym &#8266;
punysshe hym after the lawe, y<sup>t</sup> all suche olde dotardes may
take example by hym. Then y<sup>e</sup> wakers toke hym and all
nyght chastysed hym in pryson. &#8266;
on y<sup>e</sup> morne they put hym on y<sup>e</sup> pyllery. Tho sayd to the Emperoure,
Lorde haue ye ynderstonde what I haue sayd
&#8266;
he sayd ryght well. Tho sayd y<sup>e</sup> mayster, yf ye put
to dethe your sone by y<sup>e</sup> excytacyon
of your wyfe, it shall to you worse come than it dyd to y<sup>e</sup>
knyght. The Emperour sayd she was the worste woman y<sup>t</sup>
euer I herde of that so falsely her husbande brought to shame
&#8266;
rebuke. I say to you mayster y<sup>t</sup> for y<sup>e</sup> reason of this example,
my sone shall this daye not dye. The mayster sayd to hym,
yf ye do so than do ye wysely. And y<sup>t</sup>
herafter ye shall ioye, &#8266;
I commende you to god / &#8266;
thanke you of your pacyent herynge / and of the sparynge of your sone and so he departed.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>There was in the cyte of rome a knyghte y<sup>t</sup> had two
doughters &#8266; one sone. this knyghte hadde so grete delyte in
hauntinge iustynge and turneynge that all thynge that he myght
wynne &#8266; gete he layde it and spente it therupon. In that tyme
was an emperour named Octauyan, whiche in rychesse of golde
&#8266; syluer exceded al other kynges and prynces in so moche that
he had a toure full of golde, and ordeyned a knyght to haue
y<sup>e</sup> kepynge &#8266; charge therof. This knyghte that so haunted
iustynge &#8266; other ydell games came to so grete pouerte that he
was dysposed to sel his herytage, &#8266; called to hym his sone and
sayd. My sone it behoueth me of your counseyll, for necessyte
and pouerte compelleth me to sell myn herytage, or elles for to
fynde an other way by the whiche I maye lyue, for yf I sholde
sell myn heritage ye &#8266; your systers sholde perysshe. The sone
sayde, fader yf ye can fynde ony other meane without sellynge
of the herytage, I sholde be redy to helpe you. To whome
y<sup>e</sup> fader sayd I am bethought vpon a good counseyll. Themperour

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>

hath a toure full of golde / by nyght tyme lete vs go
thyder with instrumentes and dygge and hewe through the
toure, and lete vs take of the golde as moche as shal suffyse us.
Therto answered the sone &#8266; sayd, that co&#363;seyl can not be
amended, for it is better of themperoures golde to take to helpe
vs than our herytage to sell. They rose vp bothe in a nyght
and went to the toure and with instrumentes they made there
thrugh an hole, and toke as moche golde as they bothe coude
cary away at that tyme. The knyght payed his dettes &#8266;
haunted ayen iustes as he dyde before tyll all was sp&#275;te and
consumed. In the meane whyle the keper of y<sup>e</sup> tresoure went
in to the toure &#8266; whan he saw the tresoure stolen, &#8266; a grete
hole made through the wall, he began to waxe sore aferde &#8266;
went to themperour and shewed how it was befallen. To
whome themperour sayd all angrely, what nedest y<sup>u</sup> to shewe
that haue I not delyuered to the my tresoure / &#8266; therfore of the
I wyll aske it. Tho anone as the keper herde that went to
the toure ayen, &#8266; set afore the hole a grete vessel ful of pytche
medled with other gummes so subtely, that noo man myght
come in at that hole but that he must nedes fall into that
vessell, &#8266; yf he therin fyll he coude no more come out of it.
Not longe after the knyghte had all the golde consumed and
spent &#8266; went ayen with his sone to the toure to stele more
golde. And as the fader went in fyrste, anone he was fallen in
y<sup>e</sup> ves<i>sel</i> with pytche to the necke. &#8266; whan he saw that he was
taken and coude not gete out he sayd to his sone, folow me

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>

not, for yf thou doost thou may not escape to be taken. Than
y<sup>e</sup> sone sayd, god defende it y<sup>t</sup> I sholde not helpe you: for yf
ye are founden we are all but dede, &#8266; yf that ye may not be
holpen by me, I shall seke counseyll how that ye may be
delyuered &#8266; holpen. The fader sayd / there is none other
counseyll, but with thy swerde smyte of myne heed / and as my
body is founde without hede, noo man shall knowe me. &#8266; so y<sup>u</sup>
and my dought<i>er</i>s may escape &#8266; auoyde th<i>i</i>s wordly shame &#8266;
dethe. The sone sayde, Fader ye haue gyuen y<sup>e</sup> best counseyll,
For yf it were so that ony man myght perceyue ony
knolege of you, none of vs sholde escape y<sup>e</sup> deth &#8266; therfore it is
expedient that your hede be smyten of. Anone he drewe out
his swerde &#8266; smote of his faders hede &#8266; caste it into a pytte. &#8266;
afterwarde hyd it therin and yede and shewed to his systers all
the mater, whiche many dayes after pryuely bewayled the dethe
of theyr fader. After this y<sup>e</sup> keper of y<sup>e</sup> tresour came in to the
toure &#8266; founde a body w<sup>t</sup>out ony hede. whereof he wondred
sore, and shewed it to y<sup>e</sup> emperour. To whome he sayde,
byn&#772;de that body at the tayle of an horse &#8266; so drawe it by al
the stretes of the cyte, &#8266; dyligently take good hede yf ye here
ony crye or wepynge. wheresoo euer ye here that he is lorde of
the house, take all them &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> the body drawe them to the
galowes &#8266; hange them. The whiche themperours seruauntes
fulfylled accordinge to his c&#333;ma&#363;dem&#275;t. And as they came
ayenst the house of the dede knyght, &#8266; as the doughters sawe
y<sup>e</sup> body of theyre dede fader, they made a merueylous grete shryche

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>

&#8266; wept pyteously &#8266; as ther broder that herd, anone he wounded
hymself greuously in the mouthe with a knyfe, so that grete
plente of bloode came oute of the wounde. The offycers whan
the herde that noyse &#8266; crye entred in to the house, and
demaunded the cause of theyr noyse &#8266; clamour. Tho answered
the sone that I am thus wounded, for whan my systers sawe my
bloode so habundauntly go oute as ye see, they began to wepe
and crye. And whan the offycers sawe the wounde they byleued
his wordes, &#8266; so dysceyued went theyr wayes, and hynge (<i>sic</i>)
the body of the knyght vpon the galowes where it hynge long
tyme &#8266; his sone wolde neyther take his body downe frome the
galowes, ne yet bury his hede. y<sup>e</sup> Empresse sayd vnderstande ye

<p>Tho spake thempresse, thus my lorde I fere me it shalbe
of you &#8266; of your sone. This knyght for loue of his sone was
made poore. &#8266; fyrste he commytted thefte &#8266; brake the toure,
secondary dyde hymself too be heded, that his chyldren sholde
haue no shame. After y<sup>e</sup> sone cast his hede in a dyke, &#8266; buryed
it nether in chyrche nor in chyrcheyerde, his body he suffred
to hange styll vpon the galowes, yf that he coude not haue
taken it downe in the daye he myght wel haue done in y<sup>e</sup> nyght.
In the same maner y<sup>e</sup> laboure nyght and day that ye maye
promote your sone to honoure &#8266; ryches. But without doubte
he dayly laboureth for your confusyon &#8266; destructyon that he

y<sup>t</sup> ye do h&#563; to be hanged before or he you destroye. Themperour
sayd ye haue shewed me a good example. The knyghtes
sone whan he had smyten of his faders hede wolde not bury it.
Without doute my [son] fader (<i>sic</i>) shall not do so by me, but
he communded (<i>sic</i>) anone his offycers that they sholde lede hym

to the galowes. &#8266; they obeyed his c&#333;ma&#363;dement hastely. &#8266; as
they lad hym thrugh the stretes y<sup>e</sup> people made grete noyse &#8266;
lamentacyon. alas alas the onely sone of the emperour is lad
ayen towardes y<sup>e</sup> galowes / &#8266; as they thus ladde hym the thyrde
mayster named Craton came ryd&#563;g vpon an hors / &#8266; as y<sup>e</sup>
chylde sawe hym he bowed downe his hede to hym as though

O good mayster hast you &#8266; saue youre dyscyple. He smote
his horse w<sup>t</sup> spores &#8266; haysted him to y<sup>e</sup> palays. And whan he
came before themperoure he honourably salued hym, whiche
sayd, thy comyng hyther shall neuer auayll the / nor it that y<sup>u</sup>

be rebuked. The emperour sayd / as ye haue deserued so shal
it be to you. To whom he sayd, my lord what haue I deserued.
Themperour sayde, ye haue ryghte well deserued deth, for why
I delyuered to you my sone well spekynge &#8266; wel manered for

dompe to speke &#8266; the defe to here. But in that ye saye y<sup>t</sup> he
wolde haue your wyfe enforced that wolde I gladly knowe yf
ony creature haue y<sup>t</sup> seen, for there is no malyce aboue y<sup>e</sup>
malyce of a woman / and that shall I proue by a good example
that w&#563;men are full of les&#563;ges &#8266; decepc&#333;ns, &#8266; yf ye put to deth
your sone for the wordes of your wyfe / it shall happen to you

as it dyd to a noble man of his wyfe &#8266; of his pye, the whiche
he loued merueylously. To whome themperour sayd, you tell

sayd I wyll not do it / but yf ye fyrst calle ayen your sone frome

<p>Somtyme was in the cyte of rome seuen wyse maysters by

that than was dyde no thynge or attempte w<sup>t</sup>out the counseyll
of them, as they vnderstode that themperour was to them soo
inclyned, y<sup>t</sup> without theym he sholde ordeyne or doo noo thynge.
in y<sup>e</sup> meane tyme they made by theyr arte and conn&#563;g y<sup>t</sup>
themperour sholde clerely se as longe as he was in his palays

that experyment, they coude neuer chaunge it ne fordo it,
afterwarde, but themperour abode styl bl&#563;d many yeres. Then
the vii maysters made &#8266; ordeyned throughout thempyre, that
yf ony man had dremed a dreme he sholde come vnto them w<sup>t</sup>
a florene of golde or of syluer, &#8266; they sholde expowne &#8266; declare

vnto them the Interpretacyon of theyr dremes wherby &#8266; by
other vniuste meanes they obteyned moche more substaunce &#8266;

whan he sate at the table w<sup>t</sup> the empresse he began to syghe &#8266;
sorowe in hymselfe. and whan she perceyued that she enquyred
dylygently of hym y<sup>e</sup> cause of his heuynesse &#8266; doloure. Themperour

grete mater, &#8266; of y<sup>t</sup> we wolde gladly y<sup>t</sup> ye coude fynde a remedy.
The chylde sayd, shewe me your mater. And they sayd
themperour of rome as longe as he is in his palays he hath his

And whan they came w<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> chylde before themperour they sayd

Good maysters woll ye take it vpon you &#8266; abyde therby that

this was done &#8266; fulfylled / the well with the vii. sprynges were
vanysshed. And as themperour had his syghte ayen he made
the chylde a grete lorde &#8266; gaue hy<i>m</i> grete habunda&#363;ce of goodes.
After that spake thempresse, my lorde haue ye this example
well perceyued that I haue tolde you. &#8266; he sayd ye in the best
wyse. ye haue recyted a good and a ryall example. Than

in shorte tyme ye shal perceyue other th&#563;ges. but y<sup>e</sup> tyme is
not yet comen. But in y<sup>t</sup> ye say he wolde haue oppressed your

sayd, Thynke ye to doo with me ye olde dotarde, as
somtyme seuen wyse men dyde to an emperour. Therto sayd
y<sup>e</sup> mayster The offence or trespace of one or yet of twenty,

lyued without wyfe &#8266;
chylde. His frendes came to hym many
tymes &#8266;
counseyled and exhorted him that he sholde take a
wyfe. The knyght thus counseyled &#8266;
styred by his frendes soo
oftymes that at the laste he agreed too theym. And they gaue
hym to wyfe the doughter of the prouost of rome that ryche
was &#8266;
ryght fayre, whome whan he had seene anone he was
made blynde &#8266;
taken in her loue, &#8266;
began to loue her meruaylously
wel and whan they had ben a certayne space togyder
&#8266; had no fruyte ne chylde.
Upon a tyme in a mornynge it
happened that she went to the chyrche where she met w<sup>t</sup> her
moder, &#8266;
saluted her as it behoued. My dere doughter sayd the
moder how pleaseth you your maryage &#8266;
your husbonde: she
sayd ryght euyll, for ye haue gyuen to me an olde lame man /
me in al th&#563;ges dyspleasynge. I wolde ye had that same tyme
buryed me, for I had leuer lye &#8266;
ete with a swyne than with
hym, and therfore I may no longer thus endure, but I must

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>

loue another. Tho sayd y<sup>e</sup> moder, god forbede that My dere
doughter howe longe tyme I haue be with your fader &#8266; yet
hytherto I neuer medled me with suche folysshenes. The
doughter sayde, moder it is noo meruayle for ye bothe in your
youth met togyder, &#8266; the one toke solace of the other, &#8266; I may
receyue of hym noo maner of solace corporall for he is colde /
&#8266; vpon y<sup>e</sup> bed he lyeth as styll as a stone, or as a thyng
immouable: The moder answered, yf ye wyll loue another say
me what he is. The doughter sayd a preest I wyl loue. to
whome y<sup>e</sup> moder sayd it were better to you &#8266; lesse syn to loue
a knyght or a squyer than a preest. &#8266; the doughter sayde, If
I shold loue a knyght or a gentel squyer in shorte tyme he
wolde be wery of me, &#8266; after y<sup>t</sup> he wolde do me shame &#8266; tell
it ouer all, &#8266; so it is not of the preest, for he wyll holde and
kepe his owne honoure &#8266; counseyll as well as m&#563;n, And also
spyrytuell men be more true to theyr loues than the seculer
men. The mod<i>er</i> sayd, Here my counseyll &#8266; it shall be good for
you. Olde folkes are wylly &#8266; fell, tempte your husbonde fyrst
&#8266; yf ye scape hym w<sup>t</sup>out doynge ony harme or smyt&#563;ge, than
loue the preest. The dought<i>er</i> sayd I maye not so longe abyde.
The moder sayd vpon my blessynge abyde tyll ye haue proued
hym. The doughter sayde vpon your blessynge I wyll abyde
so longe, tyll I haue attempted hy<i>m</i> but fyrst say me how that I
shal proue hym. The moder sayde, He hath in his orchyerde
a tree whiche he loueth moche. do y<sup>t</sup> to be smyten downe
whyles he is oute at hontynge. &#8266; ayenst his comynge make

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>

hym there a fyre, &#8266; yf he forgyue it you th&#257; maye surely loue
the preest. As she had herde the co&#363;seyl of her moder she
went to her house. To whom her husbonde sayd, Where haue
ye ben so longe. She answered I haue ben in the chyrche
where as I met w<sup>t</sup> my moder &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> her a lytell I haue talked &#8266;
comyned, &#8266; so began proprely for to dyssymyle. After mydday
y<sup>e</sup> knighte rode out for to hu<i>n</i>te. Then she thynk&#563;ge vpon y<sup>e</sup>
counseyll of her moder went to the gardyner &#8266; sayde to hy<i>m</i>.
Cut downe this yonge tree newly planted that I may make a
fyre therof to warme my lorde withal at his comynge from
hunt&#563;ge, for it is a grete wynd &#8266; a ryght sharpe colde. The
gardyner sayde, Madame y<sup>t</sup> wyll I not do, for my lorde loueth
better that tre than he dothe all y<sup>e</sup> other trees neuertheles I shal
wel helpe you to gadre wood ynough for to make withall a
good fyre but in onywyse this I wyl not hewe downe. She
herde that, &#8266; boldly she toke y<sup>e</sup> axe from y<sup>e</sup> gardyner &#8266; hewed
downe the tree her selfe &#8266; made y<sup>e</sup> gardyner w<sup>t</sup> other to bere it
home. At euyn whan y<sup>e</sup> lorde came from huntynge he was
sore a colde The lady lete make a grete fyre, &#8266; went &#8266; met
w<sup>t</sup> hym, &#8266; set hym on a stole afore the fyre to warme. And
as he a lytell whyle had sytten he perceyued y<sup>e</sup> odoure of the
fyre. &#8266; called to hym y<sup>e</sup> gardyner &#8266; sayd, I fele by this odour y<sup>t</sup>
my newe plante brenneth in the fyre. The gardiner sayde,
Lorde it is trewe, my lady your wyfe hath felled it down. The
knyght sayd to her god forbede that my plante sholde be cut
downe by you. She answered anone &#8266; sayd, Lorde I haue done

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>

it knowyng the weder colde &#8266; you also colde. &#8266; therfore I haue
ordeyned this fyre for your c&#333;forte. As the knyght y<sup>t</sup> herde
he loked angrely vpon her &#8266; sayd, O cursed woman, how werest
y<sup>u</sup> so hardy to hewe downe so gentyl a yonge tre y<sup>e</sup> whiche y<sup>u</sup>
knowest wel y<sup>t</sup> I loued aboue al other trees As she that herde
she began to wepe &#8266; excuse her selfe &#8266; sayd My lorde I haue
done it for your good &#8266; prouffyte, &#8266; ye take it so greuously.
&#8266; began to cry wo wo be to me. Anone as y<sup>e</sup> knyght sawe
ye wep&#563;ge &#8266; teeres of his wyfe &#8266; herde her cause he was
meued w<sup>t</sup> mercy saynge to her, Cesse of your wep&#563;g, &#8266; beware
how y<sup>t</sup> ye ony more angre or trouble me in ony th&#563;ge
/ that I loue. The next daye erly in the morn&#563;ge / she
went ayen to the chyrchewarde, &#8266; met w<sup>t</sup> her moder com&#563;ge
ayenst her. &#8266; they salued eche other. Than y<sup>e</sup> doughter
sayd to her moder, O dere moder I wyll loue the preest, for
I haue attempted my lorde as ye co&#363;seyled me / but all for
nought, for he anone forgaue it whan he sawe me a lytell
wepe. Tho sayd y<sup>e</sup> moder, though olde men one tyme forgyue
/ they double the payn vpon an other tyme. &#8266; therfore I
counseyll you y<sup>t</sup> ye an other tyme attempte hym. Tho sayde
the doughter I maye no lenger abyde, for I suffer so moche
payn for the loue of y<sup>e</sup> preest, that w<sup>t</sup> my tonge I canne not
tell, therfore ye shall perdone me I wyll noo more folowe or do
after your counseyll. than sayde the moder, for the loue that
the chylde sholde haue vnto the moder attempte hym yet ones.
&#8266; for your faders blessynge / and thenne yf ye goo quyte w<sup>t</sup>out

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>

ony harme or betinge, loue the preest in the name of god. tho
answered y<sup>e</sup> doughter, it is to me a grete payn so long tyme to
abyde. neuertheles for y<sup>e</sup> blessyng of my fader I shal ons at&#275;pte
hym. but say me how I shall begyn. the moder sayd I vnderstande
y<sup>t</sup> he hath a lytell ho&#363;de y<sup>t</sup> he loueth wel &#8266; y<sup>t</sup> kepith his
bed. cast y<sup>e</sup> ho&#363;d w<sup>t</sup> so grete might afore his face that it dy &#8266;
yf ye scape w<sup>t</sup>out a strype or that he forgyue it lyghtely, in the
name of god than loue the preest. Than sayd the doughter,
I shall in all thynge doo after your co&#363;seyll, for there is noo
doughter lyuynge to day y<sup>t</sup> wolde more gladly haue y<sup>e</sup> blessynge
of the fader &#8266; the moder than I. And so she bad her moder
fare well / &#8266; went to her house ayen / &#8266; that day w<sup>t</sup> grete
importunyte &#8266; trouble of herte she brought too the nyght.
&#8266; whan the nyghte was comen, she c&#333;maunded the bed to be
couered w<sup>t</sup> pupure &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> clothe of golde the whyles the knyght
sate by the fyre. And whan the bed was thus made redy. the
lytell hounde as he was accustomed lepte on the bedde &#8266; she
toke hym by the hynder legges, &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> a wood &#8266; a malycyous
herte she cast it ayenst the wall y<sup>t</sup> it lay styll dede. Whan the
good olde knyght that sawe / he was merueylously angry. &#8266;
sayd w<sup>t</sup> a loude voyce too his wyfe, O worste &#8266; most cruell of
all wycked wymmen how coudest y<sup>u</sup> fynde in thyn herte that
lytell gentyll hounde to sle, y<sup>t</sup> I so moche loued. Lorde sayd
she haue ye not sene how the hounde w<sup>t</sup> his foule fete hath our
bed that is soo precyously couered with ryche clothes made
foule comynge out of the myre: And the knyghte sayde

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>

w<sup>t</sup> moche anger, knewe ye not y<sup>t</sup> I loued moche better
that lytell hounde than the bed. Whan she herde that, anone she began
pytyously to wepe &#8266;
sayd woo be to me that I was borne for
all thynge that I doo for the best it is all tourned in to the
worste. The knyght wolde not suffre the wepynge and weymentynge
of his wyfe. but for that y<sup>t</sup> he loued her soo moche
he sayd to her leue or cesse your wep&#563;ge for I forgyue you it
all togyder. And I counseyll you that ye beware how that ye
dysplease me from hens forth / &#8266; they went toogyder to bed.
Upon y<sup>e</sup> morowe she rose vp erly &#8266; went to the chyrche where
as she found her moder / to whome whan she hadde done reuerence
as it behoued, She sayd, moder now wyll I loue y<sup>e</sup> preste,
for I haue now attempted the seconde tyme my husbonde &#8266; all
thynges he suffred. The moder sayde, O my dere doughter
there is noo cruelte or falshede aboue the cruelte of olde folkes.
&#8266; therfore I co&#363;seyll you y<sup>t</sup> ye yet ones proue hym. To whom
the doughter answered, Moder ye laboure in vayne. for yf ye
wyst what &#8266; how moche payne y<sup>t</sup> I suffer for y<sup>e</sup> prestes loue
ye sholde rather helpe me yf ye loued me. The moder sayd,
Here me doughter this one tyme, &#8266; I shal neuer let you more.
Th&#563;ke howe y<sup>t</sup> ye haue souked mylke of my brestes: &#8266; the
grete payne that I suffred for you at your byrth. By thyse
paynes my dere doughter I desyre of &#8266; I charge you y<sup>t</sup> ye
denye me not this good petycyon. &#8266; I promyse to god I shall
no more let nor h&#563;der you of your entente: but rather helpe you
therto. / Tho answered y<sup>e</sup> doughter, it is to me a grete payne

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>

to absteyne me &#8266; forbere my selfe, so longe from the loue of
the preest. neuerthelesse for y<sup>e</sup> grete charges that ye haue layde
too me, and also for y<sup>t</sup> ye haue made a vowe no more for to
lette me, but to further me, tell me how I shall attempte hy<i>m</i>, &#8266;
I shal ones yet put it in aduenture. The moder sayd, I know
well that on sondaye next comyng he entendeth to haue vs all
to dyner &#8266; there shall be your fader &#8266; I and all your frendes
&#8266; al y<sup>e</sup> best of the cyte. And whan ye are set in your place &#8266;
all the metes are brought &#8266; serued vpon the table / faste one
of the keyes preuely y<sup>t</sup> hangeth at your gyrdell in the table
clothe &#8266; than fayne to haue forgoten your knyfe and say thyse
wordes openly. Se what a shorte wytte that I am of, I haue
forgoten my knyf in my chambre / &#8266; ryse vp hastely &#8266; go. &#8266; y<sup>e</sup>
cloth w<sup>t</sup> al the metes ye shall caste down &#8266; ouerthrowe vpon the
grounde. And yf ye scape w<sup>t</sup>out payn I make a vowe to god I
shall neuer let you after. The doughter sayde y<sup>t</sup> shall I gladly
doo &#8266; so toke her leue &#8266; departyd. The feste daye came y<sup>t</sup> all as
the moder sayd were boden. The serua&#363;tes made redy &#8266;
couered y<sup>e</sup> table. All were set at y<sup>e</sup> table. &#8266; the doughter sate
ouer ayenste her lorde. And whan the table was well serued
w<sup>t</sup> metes &#8266; other thynges as therto belonged / y<sup>e</sup> lady of the
house sayd with an high voyce, se how forgeteful I am of mynd
I haue lefte my knyfe in my chamber y<sup>e</sup> whiche I muste fetche /
&#8266; rose hastely vp and drewe y<sup>e</sup> clothe with all the mete that
was vpon it with her. a<i>n</i>d all the golde vessels &#8266; saltes lay vpon
y<sup>e</sup> gro&#363;de. The knyght vexed sore angrye in his herte, but

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>

for shame he dyssymyled afore his gestes, &#8266; c&#333;ma&#363;ded on other
clene clothe &#8266; other metes to be brought &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> Joy and myrth
he solyted &#8266; meued his gestes to ete and make good chere. so
that by hy<i>m</i> they were all gladed. The feste or dyner done
they gaue all thank&#563;ges to y<sup>e</sup> knyght &#8266; toke theyr leue &#8266;

&#8266; sayd too hym, Mayster are ye experte in blode letynge in

in what vayne y<sup>t</sup> ye can name in mannes body. The knyghte
sayd, I am well contente come on w<sup>t</sup> me. &#8266; whan he was
comen to his house he entred in to his chamber where his wyfe
laye in bed &#8266; sayd to her Ryse vp shortely. Than sayd she,
what shall I do vp thus erly it is not yet nyne the clocke. The
knyght sayd, ye muste ryse vp, for ye muste be letten blode on
both your armes. she sayd, I was neuer laten blode / &#8266; shall I

that god hath wroughte, without that thou holdest oute thyn
arme strayte I shall sone haue thyn herte blood. and he sayd
also to the barbour, smyte harde &#8266; make a depe hole in her
arme, or elles I shall gyue you a grete strype. Than smote y<sup>e</sup>
barbour so sore that the bloode came habunda&#363;tly out. and the
knyght wolde not suffer hym to staunche it vnto the tyme that
she chaunged coloure in her vysage. And as this was done the
knyght had to be stopped or sta&#363;che y<sup>t</sup> vayne. &#8266; bad y<sup>e</sup> barbour

ryght cruell &#8266; fell, wyll ye nowe loue the preste. Whiche
sayd, The deuyll may the preest confounde &#8266; shame. I wyl
neuer loue other but my husbonde. Than sayde the mayster
to themperour, Lorde haue ye vnderstande me. And he
answered ryght well, for amonges all other y<sup>t</sup> euer I haue
herde this was the best example. Thre euyll dedes she dyde
vnto her husbonde &#8266; I doute not but yf she had done y<sup>e</sup> fourth
she sholde haue shamed hym for euer. Than sayd y<sup>e</sup> mayster
therfore I counseyll you y<sup>t</sup> ye beware of your wyfe leste that it

<p>Octauianus themperour reygned in Rome ryghte ryche &#8266;
coueytous. &#8266; aboue all thynges he loued golde. The cytezyens
y<sup>t</sup> tyme of Rome dyde moche harme &#8266; many grete outrages to
other nacyons. In soo moche that dyuerse nacyons &#8266; regyons
were meued &#8266; styred ayenst y<sup>e</sup> Romayns. In that tyme there
was mayster Uirgilius, y<sup>e</sup> whiche excelled in magique &#8266; in other
scyences all other maysters. The cytezeyens prayed hym that
he by his arte &#8266; conn&#563;ge wolde make somwhat by the whiche
they of theyr ennemyes myght haue warny<i>n</i>g &#8266; knowlege byfore.
Wherby that they myght puruey for themselfe y<sup>e</sup> better. He
lete doo make by his arte and conn&#563;ge a toure, &#8266; aboue vpon
y<sup>e</sup> toure dyde to be set as many ymages as in al the worlde
were regyons and prouy<i>n</i>ces. and in the myddes of the toure he
let to be made and set an ymage, whiche helde in his hande an
appell or a grete ro&#363;de balle of golde. And euery ymage of the
toure helde in his hand a lytell bell, and stode torned lokynge
towardes his owne prouynce to hym assygned. And as oftentymes

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>

as ony prouynce wolde styre or rebel ay&#275;ste the romaynes,
so often torned hym the ymage of y<sup>t</sup> londe &#8266; range the bell.
That her&#563;ge the cytezeyns of Rome armed themselfe &#8266; to that
prouynce yede with all theyr myght for that londe to kepe
vnder. And soo was there no londe so grete y<sup>t</sup> coude wreke
them vpo<i>n</i> the romaynes, and therfore were they bedradde and
fered ouer all the worlde. After that Mayster Uirgilius<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> made
for the solace and conforte of the poor people a lyght that
alwaye brende, and by that lyghte he made two bathes, the one
of them hote, in the whiche the poore people myghte bathe and
wasshe theym / &#8266; that other colde in the whiche they myghte
theymselfe refresshe, and betwyx that lyghte and the bathes he
made an ymage standynge, in whos forhede was wryten: He y<sup>t</sup>
smyteth me shall anone haue vengeaunce. This ymage stode
there many yeres. At the laste there came a clerke and behelde
that ymage &#8266; radde this wrytynge / and thoughte in hymselfe,

yf ony man sholde smyte the that thou fyllest there w<sup>t</sup> to y<sup>e</sup>

is thy wrytynge that no man sholde haue it. &#8266; the clerke lyfte
vp hys hande &#8266; gaue the ymage a grete stroke y<sup>t</sup> it fell to y<sup>e</sup>
grou<i>n</i>de. &#8266; anone y<sup>e</sup> lyght was out. &#8266; the bathes were vanysshed
away, &#8266; he fo&#363;de no tresoure. The poore folke y<sup>t</sup> perceyuynge

for his synguler coueytyse hathe destroyed this ymage. &#8266; vs

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>

hathe robbed of so grete solace &#8266; c&#333;forthe. Here after assembled
thre kynges the whiche of y<sup>e</sup> Romayns had been oppressed
&#8266; suffred greate wronges. &#8266; went to co&#363;ysell w<sup>t</sup> them of theyr
co&#363;ysell, how they myght best of y<sup>e</sup> Romayns be auenged.
&#8266; some of the<i>m</i> sayd. we labour in vayne, as longe as there
standyth y<sup>e</sup> tour w<sup>t</sup> the ymages we maye no thynge do
ayenste theym. To y<sup>t</sup> counseylle arose vp foure knyghtes
and sayd to the kynges, we haue thoughte a goode remedy
how we shal destroye the toure w<sup>t</sup> the ymages and y<sup>t</sup> to
do and brynge aboute we wyll our lyues sette to pledge. Yf
that ye wyll do y<sup>e</sup> coste. Tho sayd y<sup>e</sup> kynges what coste
shall we do. They sayd, we must haue iiii tonnes full
of golde. Than sayd y<sup>e</sup> kynges, take that golde &#8266; fulfyll
youre promyse. The knyghtes toke y<sup>e</sup> golde &#8266; went towardes
Rome. &#8266; whan they were thyder come in the nyght w<sup>t</sup>out
one of y<sup>e</sup> yates in the dyche w<sup>t</sup> water they drowned one of
y<sup>e</sup> tonnes w<sup>t</sup> the golde. &#8266; another tonne they drowned by
the sec&#333;de yate &#8266; the thyrde tonne by y<sup>e</sup> thyrde yate. &#8266; the
fourth ton&#772; by the fourth yate they drowned. And whan they
had thus done erly in the mornynge they entred in to y<sup>e</sup> cyte
at an houre conuenyent whan y<sup>t</sup> themperour went ouer the
marte, they dyde to hym reuerence as it behoued. Themperour
seynge them demaunded frome whens they were, or
what scyences or what seruyce y<sup>t</sup> they coude do. Whiche
answered, we are of ferre cou<i>n</i>trees &#8266; we be sothsayers so
perfyte y<sup>t</sup> there was neuer thynge so preuely or secretly

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>

hydde but y<sup>t</sup> we shall f&#563;de it by our dremes. We haue herde
that y<sup>e</sup> laboure &#8266; haue pleasure in such thynges, and therfore
came we to you for to wyte yf ye had ony nede of our seruyce /
Themperour sayd, I shall proue you &#8266; yf it be so y<sup>t</sup> I fynde
you true, ye shall haue of me grete rewardes &#8266; thanke. they
sayde we aske no thynge but y<sup>e</sup> haluen dele for our rewarde of
the golde that by vs shall be fo&#363;den. The emperour sayd, I
am therwith wel content. And thus had they with the
emperour many wordes. At euen whan themperour was
goyng to bedde they sayde too hym. My lorde yf it please
you this nyghte shall the oldest of vs set his connynge a werke
&#8266; dreme, &#8266; the thyrde day we shall shewe you his dreme &#8266;
what it sygnefyeth. Themperour sayd goo in goddis name.
And they went forth w<sup>t</sup> grete gladnesse. &#8266; all y<sup>t</sup> nyght they
passed ouer with derysions &#8266; myrth vpon truste that they
sholde come to a good purpose. whan y<sup>e</sup> thyrde daye was
comen they went erly too themperour. &#8266; the fyrste of them
sayd my lorde pleaseth you to goo with vs without one of y<sup>e</sup>
yates of thy cyte &#8266; I shall shewe you where as a tonne full of
golde is hyd. Themperour sayd, I shall go with you and se
yf it be true that ye saye. whan they were comen to the place
they drewe out y<sup>e</sup> tonne that they there afore had put / The
emperour whan he that sawe was gladde, and gaue to them
theyr parte. Tho sayde the seconde dremer, my lorde this
nyght I shal dreme. Themperour sayd, god gyue you a
good dreme. y<sup>e</sup> next nyght came he &#8266; toke out y<sup>e</sup> other

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>

tonne, and gaue it to themperoure, &#8266; toke hym his dele. In
lyke wyse dyd the thyrde. &#8266; y<sup>e</sup> fourth, vpon y<sup>e</sup> whiche
themperour was out of all mesure ioyus &#8266; glad &#8266; sayd he
had not sene afore soo true &#8266; experte sothsayers or dremers
as they were / Than sayd they al togyder at once as it had
ben out of one mouth, my lorde we haue one after another
dre<i>med</i> y<sup>e</sup> whiche as ye haue sene be all true proued. But now
yf it please you that we may dreme all togyder this nyghte,
we truste that too vs shall bee shewed where we shall fynde
a greate quantyte or substa&#363;ce of golde &#8266; of rychesse. the
Emperoure sayde god gyue to you a gode dreme y<sup>t</sup> to me and
to you may be proffytable. Unto y<sup>e</sup> next morowe they came
ayen vnto y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure &#8266; sayd to hym w<sup>t</sup> joyouse &#8266; gladde
vysages or co&#363;tena&#363;ces. My lorde we brynge gode &#8266; proffytable
tydynges, for this nyght in our slepes such &#8266; so grete
a tresour is to vs shewed y<sup>e</sup> whiche yf ye wyll suffre it for
to be soughte, ye shall be so moche enryched that in this
worlde shall be none to you lyke. Themperour sayd, where
sholde ye fynde y<sup>e</sup> hoorde or tresoure. they sayd, vnder the
fundament of the tour y<sup>t</sup> the ymages standen on. The Emperoure
answered, God defend that I sholde for loue of golde
destroye that toure w<sup>t</sup> ymages wherwith y<sup>t</sup> we of oure ennemyes
be defended &#8266; warned. They sayde too hym ayen, My lorde,
Haue ye founde vs in our saynges otherwyse than true &#8266;
ryghtful. Themperour sayd nay. O Lorde sayd they, we
with our owne hondes shall gete oute y<sup>e</sup> gold w<sup>t</sup>out hurtynge

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>

of the tour or of y<sup>e</sup> ymages. And it is expedyent y<sup>t</sup> secretly
in the nyght by vs it be done, for drede of resorte and concours
of y<sup>e</sup> people leste that ye sholde ren in the noyse &#8266; clamour of
theym, and also that they sholde not take that good and golde
away from you and vs. The Emperour sayde, Goo in the
name of god and doo your beste, as ye well can&#772;e, and I shall
to morowe erly come too you. Tho went they with joye and
gladnesse, and in the nyght they were laten in too the toure,
and with grete haste and dylygence they vndermynded it. &#8266;
on the next daye erly they mounted vpon theyr horses &#8266; rode
ayen towardes theyr owne countre with ioye &#8266; glory. And
or that they came w<sup>t</sup>out the syght of rome / the toure fell
downe. And on the morne ensuynge whan it was fallen / &#8266;
the Senatours it perceyued they sorowed gretely &#8266; there was a
grete sorowe &#8266; bewaylynge thrughout all y<sup>e</sup> cyte &#8266; went to
themperour &#8266; sayd, lorde how maye it be y<sup>t</sup> this tour is thus
fallen, by the whiche we haue alwayes had warnynge afore of
our enemyes. He answered &#8266; sayd, To me came foure fals
deceyuers &#8266; fayned themself to be foure sothsayers &#8266; y<sup>t</sup> they
coude fynde tresoure hyd in the gro&#363;de. And they sayd
that vnd<sup>r</sup> the fundacyon of y<sup>e</sup> toure was hydde an vnnumerable
s&#333;me of golde y<sup>e</sup> whiche they sholde well vndermyne w<sup>t</sup>out
hurt&#563;ge of the toure or ymages / &#8266; I gaue fayth to them &#8266;
they haue deceyued me. they answered hy<i>m</i> / ye haue coueyted
so moche golde, &#8266; for your insacyate couetyse we shall be all
destroyed. but fyrste your couetyse shall full (<i>sic</i>) vpon your selfe.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>

&#8266;
toke &#8266;
ladde hym vnto y<sup>e</sup> capytoll, &#8266; layde hym on his bac

poured his mouth full of molten golde, sayng to hy<i>m</i> ye haue

therfore ye shall dry<i>n</i>ke golde &#8266; after they
buryed hym quycke. Not long after that came thenmyes ayenst
ye Romayns, &#8266;
ouercame &#8266; destroyed them al. Than sayd
thempresse vnto themperour haue ye my lorde this example
well vnderstand &#8266; he sayd ryght well. Than sayd she, The
tour w<sup>t</sup> the ymages is your body w<sup>t</sup> your v. wyttes, as long as
ye lyue there none so hardy to trouble or make werre vpon
you ne vpon your people. That hath your sone ryght well
vnderstonde w<sup>t</sup> his vii. maysters &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> theyre false narracyons
or fables fynde how they may destroye you, for ye are ouermoche
couetyse to here &#8266; enclyned to them. &#8266; in so moche y<sup>t</sup>
they shal vndermyne you &#8266; caste you vnd<i>e</i>r fote, &#8266; br&#563;ge you to

they se y<sup>t</sup> ye be all chyldyshe or folyshe they shall destroy and
sle you. &#8266; your sone shall opteyne your empyre. Th&#275;perour
sayd, ye haue recyte to me a good ex&#257;ple. wherfore it shall not
to me happen as it dyde w<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> tour but my sone fyrste this daye
shall be hanged. To whome thempresse sayd, yf ye doo so ye
shall fare well &#8266; lyue long. Upon y<sup>e</sup> nexte day he comma&#363;ded
hy<i>m</i> to be lad to hang&#563;ge. &#8266; as he was towardes y<sup>e</sup> galowes lad,
came rydynge ayenst hym vpon an hors his fyfth mayster
towardes y<sup>e</sup> palays. &#8266; came before themperour &#8266; saluted hym
w<sup>t</sup> all reuerence / &#8266; he despysed his salutacyon. &#8266; put hym in
fere of his lyfe. &#8266; y<sup>e</sup> mayster sayd My lorde I haue not deserued

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>

to dye. &#8266; ye my salutacyon despyse it is not your honoure.
for your sone hath not with vs be of such condycyo<i>n</i>s as ye
repute hy<i>m</i> for as ye in short tyme shal fynde. &#8266; that he speketh
not is of his his (<i>sic</i>) grete wysdome. &#8266; knowe ye y<sup>t</sup> he shal
well speke as y<sup>e</sup> tyme comyth, though y<sup>t</sup> he now speke not, as
ye in shorte tyme shall here. But ye saye y<sup>t</sup> he your wyfe
wolde haue shamed. y<sup>t</sup> byleue not. for so wise a man as he is
neuer sholde atte<i>m</i>te so shamful a dede. And ye put hym to
dethe for your wyues wordes, ye sholde not scape without shame
and vengeaunce / In lyke wise as Ypocras scaped not w<sup>t</sup>out

sayd that wolde I fayne here and vnderstonde. The mayster
sayd, what sholde auayle y<sup>e</sup> narracyon to tel vnto you for your
prouffyte yf in the meane seasone your sone sholde be hanged.
&#8266; therfore yf ye wyll call ayen your sone, and therafter do as
ye thynke beste it shall be at your pleasure. Themperour lete
call ayen his sone and set him in pryson. And tho began y<sup>e</sup>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Somtyme there was a famous physycyan named Ypocras
ryght connynge, y<sup>e</sup> which exceded all other in connynge &#8266;
scye<i>n</i>ce he had w<sup>t</sup> hym his neuewe or kynnesman y<sup>t</sup> was called
Galienus, y<sup>e</sup> whiche he loued moche. This Galien<i>us</i> was of
an excell&#275;t wytte &#8266; applyed all his wytte &#8266; mynde to lerne of
h[i]s vncle the scyence of physyke. Whan Ypocras apperceyued
that in as moche as he coude hyde from hym hys conynge
ferynge that he sholde excelle hym in y<sup>t</sup> crafte, for y<sup>e</sup> grete
wytte that he was of. As Galienus this sawe, he studyed &#8266;
excersysed, in soo moche y<sup>t</sup> in shorte tyme he had perfyte connynge
physyke. for the whiche Ypocras enuyed hym moche.
It hapned vpo<i>n</i> a tyme therafter, y<sup>t</sup> the k&#563;ge of Ungary sent
his messengers vnto Ypocras that he sholde come vnto hym his
sone fer to cure or make hole. Ypocras excused h&#563;self &#8266;
wolde no goo. but sent his cosyne Galienus w<sup>t</sup> his wrytynge
in the company of y<sup>e</sup> messengers for to excuse hym. And
whan Galienus was comen afore y<sup>e</sup> kynge he was ryghte

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>

worshypfully receyued. but he merueyled why that Ypocras wolde
not come. he excused hym saynge that he had many grete
thynges too do that he myght not come, but he hath sent me
in his stede. &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> the helpe of god I shall make hole that
childe. That pleased well y<sup>e</sup> kynge. Galienus went to the
chylde. &#8266; whan he had seene his vryne, and tasted his pounces.
he sayd tho (<i>sic</i>) the quene. O excellent prynces I pray you here
&#8266; suffer my wordes, &#8266; tel me who is y<sup>e</sup> fad<sup>r</sup>of this chylde. She
sayd, who sholde be his fader but my lorde the kyng. Galienus
sayd, I am sure y<sup>t</sup> he is not the fader. She answered yf ye
wyll say y<sup>t</sup> for a trouth I shall doo your hede to be smytn of.
he answered I say yet ones agayn y<sup>t</sup> this ky<i>n</i>ge is not the fader
and I am not therfore comen hyther to lese my hede. for I
haue no suche rewarde deserued. &#8266; he was goynge his waye.
The quene y<sup>t</sup> seynge spake. O good mayster yf ye wyl kepe
it secrete, &#8266; not dyscouer me, I shal shewe &#8266; open vnto you
myn herte. The mayster sayd God defende that from me,
that I to no persone sholde shewe it. and therfore O noble
quene shewe it boldely to me for it shall neuer passe my
mouthe after. and I shall your sone ease and make hym hole.
She sayde yf ye doo that, ye shall haue of me a good rewarde.
&#8266; therfore here what I shall saye. Of fortune came hyther
vnto my lorde, the kyng of Burgondyen, and he was so longe
w<sup>t</sup> me conuersaunt that this chylde by hym I bare. Tho sayd
y<sup>e</sup> mayster, fere ye not, I knewe well that it was so byfore. &#8266;
anone he gaue the chylde to ete beef or of an oxe to dry<i>n</i>ke. and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>

the chylde was eased of his infyrmyte. And whan as the
k&#563;ge herde that the chylde was quite of his malady he gaue
vnto y<sup>e</sup> mayster a good rewarde. but of the quene he secretly
receyued and had a greter gyfte and a specyal thanke and went
his waye. And whan that he was comen home, Ypocras his
mayster demaunded of hym, haue ye y<sup>t</sup> chyld heled. &#8266; he sayd
ye. Than asked he hy<i>m</i> what he gaue to hym. &#8266; he sayd, I
gaue hy<i>m</i> fleshe of ox beef to ete, &#8266; water to dry<i>n</i>ke. Tho sayd
Ypocras. Than is the moder of that chylde not true too her
husbonde. y<sup>t</sup> is trouth sayd Galienus. Ypocras anone was
meued w<sup>t</sup> enuye, &#8266; thought in hymselfe yf here be not found
a remedy, my scyence shall no more be set by. &#8266; he shal be
named and praysed aboue me. And from that day forthwarde
he thought &#8266; deuysed how he myght slee hym. Uppon a day
Ypocras called and sayd come go we to seke and gadre herbes in
the gardyne. To whome he sayd mayster I am redy. And
whan they were comen in to y<sup>e</sup> gardyne, Ypocras sayd, I fele
that this herbe is ryght vertuous, stoupe downe &#8266; gadre me of
it. Galienus dyde so. and as they went aboute the gardyne,
sayd Ypocras now knowe I well by y<sup>e</sup> odoure of this herbe that
it is better &#8266; precyoser than golde. and therfore stoupe downe
to the gro&#363;de &#8266; drawe hym oute w<sup>t</sup> the rotes for he is ryght
moche. Galien<i>us</i> bowed hymself down to plucke vp the herbe.
Ypocras drewe out his knyfe &#8266; kylled hym. After that Ypocras
fyll seke to the dethe that y<sup>e</sup> strengthes of his body fayled hym
and dyde as moche as he coude to helpe hymself but it wold

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>

not be and as his scolers &#8266; dyscyples herde of it they went
hastely to hy<i>m</i>. &#8266; all that they myght or coude do for the prouffyte
of his helthe they dyde / but it auayled hym nothynge.
Whan Ypocras that perceyued, he sayd vntoo his scolers. Goo
and fetche me a grete tonne and fyll it full vnto the brynkes
with water. And whan they had soo done, he sayd too them
make nowe therin an hondred hooles, and whan that was doone,
there wente none of the water oute. Tho sayd Ypocras.
Beholde my moste dere dyscyples, how y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> vengeaunce of god
is fallen vpon me as ye openly may see, for in this tonne are an
hondred holes, &#8266; yet gooth there out not one droppe, ryght so
there cometh no vertue out of y<sup>e</sup> herbes to helpe me. and therfore
what ye doo to me it helpeth not, for I must dye. But
my dere chyldren yf my neuewe Galienus were now on lyue,
he sholde hele me, whom I haue slayne / y<sup>t</sup> me sore forthynketh.
&#8266; therfore y<sup>e</sup> vengea&#363;ce of god cometh ouer me.
And this sayd he torned hy<i>m</i> to y<sup>e</sup> wal &#8266; gaue vp the goost.
Tho sayd y<sup>e</sup> mayster to themperour, My lorde vnderstande ye
well what I haue sayd. He answered ye ryght well, what
hurte had it b&#275; to hym &#8266; Galienus had lyued. The mayster
answerd it had ben ryght good, for Ypocras at that tyme had
not dyed, &#8266; therfore by y<sup>e</sup> ryghtwyse Jugement of god his
medycynes auayled hy<i>m</i> not. &#8266; therefore I shewe to you y<sup>t</sup> it
shall happen worse to you, yf y<sup>t</sup> ye put to deth your sone for
y<sup>e</sup> wordes of your wyfe, which in tyme of necessyte shall assyste
&#8266; socoure you. &#8266; consyder ye not, y<sup>t</sup> ye haue after your fyrst

suche a sone y<sup>t</sup> shal kepe &#8266; saue you from peryll. Themperour
sayde truly he shal not dye. Tho sayd y<sup>e</sup> mayster than do ye
wysely, &#8266; I commende you to god, &#8266; thanke you, y<sup>t</sup> ye haue
this daye for me spared your sone. Themperour sayd I marke

<p>There was a kyng ryght proude &#8266; merueylously dyfformed
in his vysage in suche wyse that w&#563;men hym hated &#8266; abhorred.
This kynge thought Rome to destroye &#8266; the romaynes to slee,
&#8266; y<sup>e</sup> bodyes of Peter &#8266; Poule to take &#8266; cary awaye, whiche
while he was in this my<i>n</i>de he called to hy<i>m</i> his stewarde that
was ryght secrete w<sup>t</sup> hym of his pryue counseyll and sayd to
hym. Seke me a fayre woman y<sup>t</sup> this nyghte may slepe w<sup>t</sup> me.
The stewarde answered, My lorde ye knowe wel your
infyrmyte &#8266; dysese, &#8266; y<sup>t</sup> no woma<i>n</i> wyll doo it w<sup>t</sup>out a grete
somme of money. The ky<i>n</i>ge sayd, thynke ye y<sup>t</sup> for money I

And therfore I counseyll you that ye to vs gete that money.

My lord it shall be daye w<sup>t</sup>in a whyle, it is good that ye performe

My lorde the mornynge is comen, therfore let the woman goo,

The stewarde y<sup>t</sup> hery<i>n</i>ge coude no lenger forbere ne holde his

the cyte on all sydes, so long tyll that the Romayns wolde
haue delyuered hym for to haue departed and withdrawen hymself
from thens the bodyes of the holy apostles Petyr &#8266; Poule.
Than was there in y<sup>e</sup> cyte seuen wyse maysters as ye nowe
haue, by the cou<i>n</i>seyll of whome all the cyte was gyded &#8266;
gouerned. And the cytezeyns came too theym and sayd.
what shall we do, it behoueth vs as that we delyuere vnto
oure dedely ennemyes the bodyes of the holy apostles or elles
ye cyte. Tho answered y<sup>e</sup> fyrste mayster. I shall w<sup>t</sup> my
wysdome &#8266; connynge this day y<sup>e</sup> cyte &#8266; y<sup>e</sup> body of the apostles
saue. &#8266; so one after another promysed to doo y<sup>e</sup> same,
eueryche of theym for one daye. In lyke wyse as y<sup>e</sup> maysters
haue promysed your sone. w<sup>t</sup> that y<sup>e</sup> kynge began to assaute
the cyte on all partyes. Tho began y<sup>e</sup> fyrste mayster to saye,
&#8266; to alledge so wysely for to haue pease, y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> kynge that day
lefte his assaute makynge &#8266; withdrewe hym a lytyll fro the

shall vnderstande that y<sup>e</sup> kynge hath made his othe &#8266; sworne
that to morowe w<sup>t</sup> al his puyssaunce &#8266; strength he wyll haue

too lese our lyues. Therfore in aquytynge of your promyse
defende &#8266; kepe vs from daunger lyke as all your felowes
afore haue done. to that answered y<sup>e</sup> mayster &#8266; sayd be of good
comforte &#8266; fere not, for too morowe I shall by my connynge
shewe suche a werke and operacyons / that the kyng with all

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>

his puissaunce and myght shal fle &#8266; leue the syege. The
nexte daye the kynge made &#8266; gaue a grete assaute too the cyte.
Tho went the mayster and endued or clothed hymselfe with a
meruayvesture or clothynge hauynge therin the fethers or y<sup>e</sup>
tayles of pecockes and of other foules of dyuers coloures. and
toke two bryght swerdes in eche hande one. and went there
with all and stode vpon the hygheste toure of all the cyte. and
began to meue and torne or shewe hymselfe aboute on all partes
towarde the oste so that they myght all beholde &#8266; se hym. and
he helde in his mouthe the two bryght swerdes y<sup>t</sup> merueylously
shyned. They w<sup>t</sup>out of y<sup>e</sup> kynges hoost that seyeng sayd to
hym. O lorde beholde vpon hyghest of yonder toure a wonderfull
thynge or fygure. Ye I se it wel y<sup>t</sup> it is merueylous /
but what it is I knowe not. They sayd to hym It is Jhesus the
god of y<sup>e</sup> crysten folke y<sup>t</sup> is come out of heuen vs al to sle &#8266;
destroye w<sup>t</sup> his two swerdes yf wee here ony lenger abyde.
The kynge herynge that trembled for fere and sayde what shall
we do, there is but one way and that is that we anone go and
departe fro hens leste that theyr god auenge hvmselfe vpon vs.
Tho began y<sup>e</sup> kynge w<sup>t</sup> all his oste to fle, notwithstond&#563;ge
there was no nede. but y<sup>t</sup> they of y<sup>e</sup> mayster were begyled &#8266;
deceyued. And whan y<sup>e</sup> romaynes y<sup>t</sup> sawe they hastely
moued after al armed in good ordynaunce. &#8266; the kynge w<sup>t</sup>
many of his people they kylled and destroyed, &#8266; also in that
manere by grete subtylte of y<sup>e</sup> mayster was y<sup>e</sup> myghty kynge
w<sup>t</sup> his folke ouercomen. Then sayd thempresse to themperour,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>

Lorde haue ye vnderstande what I haue sayde. He sayd
ye, well in y<sup>e</sup> beste wyse. She sayd, haue ye no herde what
I haue sayd to you at the begynnynge of this narracyon, of
the stewarde that the kynge trusted so moche, which for lucre
of good shamed his owne wyfe, &#8266; he for that was dryuen &#8266;
banysshed out of the londe. In lyke wyse your sone for the
desyre and appetyte that he hath to the empyre, entendeth to
co<i>n</i>founde and destroye you. But while ye be in your myght &#8266;
power do with hym as y<sup>e</sup> kynge did w<sup>t</sup> his stewarde yf ye wyll
not put hym to deth, banysshe him out of your empyre, y<sup>t</sup>
ye without fere may leue in surete of your lyue. And haue
ye not also herde how y<sup>e</sup> kyng lay before y<sup>e</sup> cyte of Rome, &#8266;
howe he was by the wyse maysters dec[e]yued &#8266; scorned y<sup>t</sup> he
with his folke were kylled &#8266; slayne. In the same wyse y<sup>e</sup>
seuen maysters entende to do w<sup>t</sup> you. &#8266; by theyr false wyles
and subtyltees to deceyue you, &#8266; in the ende to sle you y<sup>t</sup> your
sone may regne. Therupon answered themperour &#8266; sayd that
shall not so be, for my sone too morowe shal deye. Than
commau<i>n</i>ded his serua&#363;tes that they sholde lede his sone to
hangynge. And as the folke herde that there was a grete
noyse &#8266; a gaderynge of theym and bewayled the dethe of y<sup>e</sup>
only sone of themperour. And as y<sup>e</sup> syxte mayster herde
that, he hasted hym too the Emperour &#8266; salued hym moche
honourably, &#8266; he toke it vntha<i>n</i>kfully, &#8266; thretned hym or
menaced him to dye w<sup>t</sup> his sone for that he was w<sup>t</sup> them made
dompe, and a rybaude, y<sup>e</sup> whiche he had shewed vpon his wyfe.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>

The mayster sayd. I haue deserued no deth w<sup>t</sup> your sone, but
grete &#8266; large gyftes, for he is not dompe as ye shall here w<sup>t</sup>in
thre dayes yf he may lyue soo longe. and yf ye put hym too
deth for wordes of your wyfe, than shall I merueyll of your
wysdome. &#8266; without doute it shall happen to you as it somtyme
happened to a knyght that so moche alowed the saynges
of his wyfe that he was bounde to an horse tayle &#8266; drawen
thrugh out all the cyte to the galowes. Themperour sayde
for the loue of god shewe me that example that I may the
better beware of that peryl. That wyl I not doo sayd the
mayster, w<sup>t</sup>out ye do cal ayen your sone. Than themperour
commau<i>n</i>ded to call his sone. And the mayster began afore al
the folke to tel in this maner folowynge.</p>

<p>There was an Emperour of Rome the whiche had thre
knyghtes whom he loued aboue al other. And in that same
cyte was an au<i>n</i>cyent knyght y<sup>t</sup> had wedded a fayre yonge wyfe
as ye do thempres whiche aboue al other thy<i>n</i>ges he loued.
This lady coude synge ryht wel, &#8266; melodyously &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> suche
swetnes y<sup>t</sup> many drewe to her house &#8266; desyred her company /
It befell vpo<i>n</i> a season as she sate in her house, y<sup>e</sup> vysage torned
in to the strete y<sup>t</sup> she myght se them that we<i>n</i>t by. &#8266; began
swetely tu synge, y<sup>t</sup> all folke delyted for to here her. By
chaunce came that wayes a knyght of y<sup>e</sup> Emperours courte &#8266;
herde that voyce, lyft vp his ey&#275; &#8266; behelde her Intentyfly &#8266;
anone he was taken in her loue, and entred in to her house &#8266;
fyll in communycacyon w<sup>t</sup> her of loue. &#8266; amonges al other he
demau<i>n</i>ded what he sholde gyue her too slepe by hym one
nyght. She answered an hondred floreyns. The knyght sayde,
tell me whan I shall come, &#8266; I shall gyue you an hondred
floreyns. She sayd whan I may haue a conuenyent tyme I

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>

shal sende for you. The nexte day she sange ayen in the
same place, and it fortuned the seco<i>n</i>de knyght of themperour
to come by that same way, the whiche in lykewyse was smyten
in her loue, &#8266; also pr<i>o</i>mysed her an hondred floreyns. To whom
also she promysed to shewe hym a tyme prouyded. The thyrd
day was the thyrd knyght in lyke wyse caught in her loue, the
whiche also promysed an ho<i>n</i>dred floreyns, &#8266; she too gyue hym
knowelege of the tyme. Thyse thre knyghtes haue so secretly
spoken with that lady y<sup>t</sup> none of them had knowlege of other.
The lady y<sup>t</sup> was of malyce &#8266; cautelous replenysshed, came to
her husbonde &#8266; sayd, syr I haue secrete maters too shewe you,
&#8266; folowe therein my counseyll yf ye do it, our necessite or
pouerte ye may largely releue. The knyght sayd tel it me I
shal holde it secrete &#8266; fulfyl it to my power. She sayde thre
knyghtes of th&#275;perours court haue ben w<sup>t</sup> me one after an
other in suche wyse y<sup>t</sup> none knoweth of an other counseyll. &#8266;
euery of them haue offred me an hondred floreyns, myght we y<sup>e</sup>
thre c florayns gete &#8266; no knowlege therof be had sholde it
not be to vs a grete helpe &#8266; our pouerte well releued. The
knyght sayd, forsoth yes, &#8266; therfore what someuer ye cou<i>n</i>seyl
me to do I shall folowe it. Tho sayd she, I shall gyue you
this counseyll. whan they come with the floreyns ye shall
stande behynde y<sup>e</sup> yate w<sup>t</sup> your swerde drawen in your hande.
&#8266; bycause y<sup>t</sup> euery of them comethe alone, ye shall sle one
after another, &#8266; so we shal haue the three c floreyns of
them without knowlege of ony other. The knyght answered.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>

O my best beloued wif I fere me that this euyll can notte be
hydde, and we sholde therfore shamefully suffre dethe yf that
it were knowen. She sayd I shall this werke begynne. &#8266; I shall
make therof a good ende, and fere it not. wha<i>n</i> the knyght
sawe that she was so hardy it caused hym to be the more bolde.
and she sent for the fyrst knyght and he came to hyr anone
with oute ony taryenge to the yate &#8266; knocked, &#8266; she askyd yf
he brought y<sup>e</sup> c floreyns. and he sayd ye, I haue theym here
all redy. Tho lete she hy<i>m</i> in. &#8266; anone at y<sup>e</sup> entrynge in, her
husbonde kylled hym &#8266; so he dyde y<sup>e</sup> seconde &#8266; the thyrde &#8266;
in to one secrete chamber they drewe the bodyes of them.
Whan it was thus done y<sup>e</sup> knyght sayd to his lady. O dere
wyfe yf thyse bodyes be founde w<sup>t</sup> vs, we shall dye y<sup>e</sup> moost
shamefull deth y<sup>t</sup> can be ymagyned for it is not possyble but
y<sup>t</sup> thyse knyghtes shall be myssed in themperours courte. &#8266;
grete serche &#8266; Inquysyon shall be for them made thrugh all
this cyte, where they are become. She sayde, Syr I haue this
werke begonne, &#8266; shal make therof a good ende, fere not, as I
afore sayd. This lady had a brother the whiche had the gouernau<i>n</i>ce
of the watche of y<sup>e</sup> cyte that on y<sup>e</sup> nyghtis vpon stretes
watched w<sup>t</sup> his felowes. She stode at her gate &#8266; called her

frendly &#8266; gaue hym wyne to drynke. &#8266; sayd, my well beloued
broder, this is y<sup>e</sup> cause y<sup>t</sup> I haue called you, for of your cou<i>n</i>seyll

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>

as this was done, he came ayen to his syster &#8266; sayde, gyue me

<p>There was somtyme a kyng, the whiche loued his wyfe aboue
all thynge. in so moche that he closed her in a stronge castell,
&#8266; bare y<sup>e</sup> keyes of the castel hymselfe. The lady was therfore
ryght heuy &#8266; desolate. Now in ferre partyes there was a
valyaunte knyght y<sup>e</sup> whiche in a nyght had a dreme after this
effecte. For he thought that he sawe one of the fayreste
quenes y<sup>t</sup> myght be. y<sup>e</sup> which aboue all thynges desyred to
haue her loue. y<sup>t</sup> yf he myghte se her walkynge he sholde
clerely haue knowlege of, by whome to hym grete frendshyp
&#8266; worship sholde come. To y<sup>e</sup> quene in y<sup>e</sup> same nyght by
vysyon of the sayd knyght, it was to her also shewed. &#8266; yet
they hadde of eche other neyther knowlege of name neyther
of fame. Whan y<sup>e</sup> knyght had thus dremed &#8266; seen in his
slepe, he thought &#8266; determyned in his mynde that his fote
sholde not reste vnto y<sup>e</sup> tyme tyll he had founde that lady, y<sup>t</sup>
to hym was shewed in his vysyon. and lepte vpon his horse /

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>

and toke with hym all that to hym was necessarye for his
journey. and rode and laboured thrughe dyuerse regyons and
londes soo longe tyll at the last he came vnto the same londe,
where that the quene was by her husbonde closed or kepte in
a stronge castel. And wha<i>n</i> this sayd knyght was come in to
y<sup>e</sup> same cyte, and by a certayne season had there soiourned, it
happened on a day as this knyght walked by the castell, and
knewe not y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> quene was therin she sate in a wy<i>n</i>dowe to
beholde &#8266;
see y<sup>e</sup> people goynge by. &#8266;
amonge all other she sawe the sayd knyght, and knewe that he was the same man
that she had dremed of. And y<sup>t</sup> knyght by chaunce lyfte vp
his eyen &#8266;
perceyued y<sup>e</sup> lady syttyng in the wyndowe.
&#8266; anone
his minde shewed hym y<sup>t</sup> it was she y<sup>t</sup> he the dremes of had.
&#8266;
he began to synge a songe of loue. And as she herde y<sup>t</sup> she
was anone taken w<sup>t</sup> his loue. The knyghte from thensforth
dayly went &#8266;
walked aboute y<sup>e</sup> castell beholdynge it ouer all
y<sup>t</sup> yf in ony maner wyse he myght gete to her too shewe his
mynde. The lady perceyuy<i>n</i>ge that she wrote a letter
&#8266; cast
it downe to hym. And whan he had sene ouer y<sup>e</sup> letter,
&#8266;
understode y<sup>e</sup> wyll of that lady, he began to haunte Joustes
&#8266;
tournamentes &#8266;
dyde so many gret &#8266;
merueylous actes or dedes, that y<sup>e</sup> name of hym came to the kynge. And as the
kynge herde that he sent after hym &#8266;
sayd to hym, Syr knyght I haue herde moche honour of you. yf it wyll please you for
to abyde &#8266;
to dwell w<sup>t</sup> vs, we shall gyue you large gyftes &#8266;
rewardes. The knyght answerd, O ryght myg[h]ty prynce
I am your seruaunte, wolde god y<sup>t</sup> I coude do ony seruyse to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>

please your magnyfycence, w<sup>t</sup>out takynge of rewarde saue one
thyng afore all other I desyre. The kynge sayd, shewe it
boldely what thynge y<sup>t</sup> it is. The knyght sayd, My lorde
sythen y<sup>t</sup> it hath pleased you for to take me as your seruau<i>n</i>t
&#8266;
one of youre counseyll, me semeth that it were expedyent for
bothe our solaces, that I hadde a place nyghe too the wall of
the castell: that I myght at all tymes be the more redy at
your callynge whan that ye haue nede. Then&#772;e the kynge sayd
I consente it to you make it as ye thy<i>n</i>ke it beste. Tho wente
the knyght &#8266; hyred werkeme<i>n</i>
&#8266; made a fayre logynge by y<sup>e</sup>
walles of y<sup>e</sup> toure. &#8266;
wha<i>n</i> it was all redy, He made a couenau<i>n</i>t
w<sup>t</sup> a werkeman for to make out of his house a secret way in
to y<sup>e</sup> tour &#8266;
whan it was made redy after his entente, he kylled
y<sup>e</sup> werkeman by cause he sholde not dyscouer.
&#8266;
went in to y<sup>e</sup> quene &#8266;
dyde to her reuerence accordy<i>n</i>g &#8266; they talked of many
thynges, y<sup>t</sup> at thende he desyred for to slepe by her, which she
oftentymes denyed, but neuery<sup>e</sup>les she co<i>n</i>sented to hy<i>m</i>. After
y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> quene thought what shall I do, yf I sholde gyue knowlege
herof vnto my husbo<i>n</i>d, therof sholde come two euyls y<sup>e</sup> one is
my shame, &#8266; y<sup>t</sup> by auenture
he sho[l]de vtterly forsake me &#8266;
dryue me out of his londe for euer, &#8266;
y<sup>e</sup> knyght he sholde sle, for fro y<sup>e</sup> dethe he coude not escape,
&#8266; therfore it is better y<sup>t</sup> I
be styll &#8266; tell not.
The knyght after y<sup>t</sup> as oftentymes as it pleased hym he went in to the quene,
&#8266; dyde his wyll

too goo too chase or huntynge, and he commaunded his stewarde for too make hym redy vppon
the morowe for too goo with hym, whertoo he offred hym selfe all redy. &#182; And on the
morowe after they entred in to y<sup>e</sup> forest,

he anone gate on his horse &#8266;
hasted hy<i>m</i> to his house, &#8266;
wente to the quene &#8266;
gave her ayen y<sup>e</sup> rynge, &#8266;
tolde her how y<sup>e</sup> kynge had marked it &#8266;

anone after y<sup>t</sup> the kynge came to the quene &#8266;
she receyued hym ryght louy<i>n</i>gly, &#8266;
after y<sup>t</sup> a lytyl tyme was passed, the kyng sayd, My lady shew me
where y<sup>e</sup> ryng is that I gaue to you, I desyre to se it. O my lorde to what

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>

desyre ye to se it. Than sayd he, yf ye shewe it not to me
Inco<i>n</i>tyne<i>n</i>t it shall repente you. She rose anone vp &#8266; went to
[her] cheste &#8266; brought the ry<i>n</i>ge to y<sup>e</sup> kynge. And as he sawe
y<sup>e</sup> rynge he was half ashamed, &#8266; sayd vnto her, O howe lyke is
the knyghtes rynge vnto this rynge, whyche I sawe vpon his
fynger, and I bileued that it had ben my rynge, and therfore it
was that I asked it of you so hastely after the rynge. And of

lady, in this behalfe, for y<sup>e</sup> strength of the toure deceyued me,
for I thy<i>n</i>ke y<sup>t</sup> noo man myght come therin, but I myself alone.
She sayde, My dere lorde, wond<sup>r</sup> not for one rynge is lyke an
other, for werke men make seldome ony werke, but y<sup>e</sup> other
make the same, but god forgyue it you that ye haue had me suspect
whan ye knowe the strength of y<sup>e</sup> toure,
&#8266; the keyes
ye haue alway by you, &#8266;
byleue no man therw<sup>t</sup>. After y<sup>t</sup>

sayd to the ky<i>n</i>ge, my lorde it is so that my lady in loue is come out of my countre
&#8266;
I haue done to be made a feste or a dyner.
&#8266;
gladly I wolde pray you that at this tyme ye wyll doo me honour,
&#8266;
take suche mete as is in my house. he kynge sayd I shal gladly do you y<sup>t</sup>

The knight was therof glad, &#8266;
by his secrete way went to the quene &#8266;
sayd to her, My lady this day ye shal come to my house by my preuy way,
&#8266;
clothe you in ryche clothynge after the way of my cou<i>n</i>tre,
&#8266;

fulfyll, &#8266;
whan the houre of mete was come, &#8266; the ky<i>n</i>ge from
the castell was comyng towardes the knyghtes house, In the
meane tyme the quene entred by the secrete way in to the
knyghtes lodgynge &#8266;
apparayled her after the maner of the
knyghtes countre. and whan the kynge was entred in to the
house, she salued hym reuerently and receyued hym. and whan
the kynge hadde beholden her he demaunded of the knyghte,
what woman is this that is so fayr. Then y<sup>e</sup> knyght sayd my
lorde it is my souerayne lady that now is come out of my
cou<i>n</i>tre after me. I haue taryed longe in her seruyce. Then
the knyght set the kynge att y<sup>e</sup> table as it behoued.
&#8266; made the
quene to syt by hym / &#8266;
the kynge thoughte that it was his
quene, and sayd w<sup>t</sup>in hymself, O how lyke is this woman vnto
my wyfe. So y<sup>e</sup> strength of the toure deceyued hym, that he
gaue more fayth and credence to y<sup>e</sup> knyghtes wordes than he
dyde vnto his owne eyen. The quene began&#772;e for
to speke &#8266;
talke vnto the kynge and to styre hym for to ete and drynke
&#8266;
to make good chere. And wha<i>n</i> as the kynge herde her voyce
and speche than he sayd to hymselfe, O blessed lady, lyke is
this woman vnto my quene, in her behauyng / in speche / in
vysage / &#8266;
in all other thy<i>n</i>ges &#8266;
condycyons. and alwayes y<sup>e</sup> strengthe of the toure fayled hym.
In the ende of y<sup>e</sup> mete, y<sup>e</sup> knyghte prayed his loue
to synge a songe afore y<sup>e</sup> kyng the whiche began for to synge a
songe of loue. whan as he herde that &#8266;
knewe her voyce, he thought is not this my wyfe. How
may it be she. haue not I the keyes of y<sup>e</sup> toure my selfe in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>

kepynge. and soo all the mete tyme he sate and strofe within
hymselfe. Tho att the laste he sayde vnto the knyght that
he sholde take vp the table for he hadde somwhat for too done
for why that he sate in suche a grete thought, and aduysem&#275;t.
The knyght answered and sayde, My lorde ye make noo good
chere, ye are full of thoughtes. And yf it please you we shall
make to you more sporte &#8266;
solace. And the woman sayd please it you syr kynge here by vs tarye. we shall make you
all the sporte &#8266;
solace that we can, lyke as y<sup>e</sup> quene is in her
solace &#8266;
conforte. He sayd take away the table, for I may no
lenger abyde. Then the knyght at the commaundement of y<sup>e</sup>
kynge toke vp the table, &#8266;
thanked theym all. And y<sup>e</sup> kynge wente hastely vnto the castell in
serchynge whether y<sup>t</sup> the quene were w<sup>t</sup>in or not.
And in the meane whyle the quene went vp by her preuy way,
&#8266;
put of her vppermost vestures &#8266;
the kynge founde her in the same clothynge that he lefte her
afore. Whan as the kynge was entred &#8266;
so founde her, he embraced &#8266;
kyssed her &#8266;
sayd vnto her. This day I haue eten w<sup>t</sup> my knyghte and w<sup>t</sup> his
loue that is come out of his cou<i>n</i>tree, and sythen I was borne vnto this
day myn eyen hath not sene two so lyke creatures in al thyng as she is to you and this
mete tyme I haue be soo moche styred with dyuerse thy<i>n</i>ges y<sup>t</sup>
I coude no lenger abyde there, but y<sup>t</sup> I muste come
&#8266; serche
whether ye were here or theyre. Tho sayd y<sup>e</sup> quene, Syr how
myght ye thynke y<sup>t</sup>, for ye knowe well y<sup>t</sup> this
toure is fast, &#8266;
stronge ynoughe &#8266;
that no body can come in nor out w<sup>t</sup>out

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>

you, for ye alone haue alwayes the keye. How were it then possyble
for me to be there. Ye fynde somtyme one man lyke on
other and therfore ye sholde take none argum&#275;tes of mysdemyng
or of suspycion, as ye late dyde of the rynge. The kynge sayd,
that is true and therfore I knowlege my selfe gylty that I haue
mysdemed you. After that came to hym y<sup>e</sup> knyght
&#8266; sayd,
My lorde I haue of long tyme serued your good grace, and now
it is tyme that I retourne ayen in to my countre
&#8266; therfore for
all the seruyce y<sup>t</sup> I haue done vnto you I desyre of you but one
thynge to do for me. y<sup>t</sup> my lorde ye whiche I entende to wedde
in the face of the chyrche, which hath folowed me out of ferre
countrees, &#8266;
her I shall brynge thyder ayen as my laweful wyfe.
Therfore I beseche and praye your noble grace that ye wyll do
me this honour, that by your owne honde ye wyll gyue her
afore the preest vnto me, the whiche shallbe vnto me greete
honour and worshyp whan I come into my countree. The
kynge answered, y<sup>t</sup> petycyon and more yf ye desyre it that
shall I gladly doo and fulfyll it. The knyght prefyxed the
daye of maryage. To the whiche daye this good kynge came
to the chyrche worshypfully. The preest was redy
&#8266; stode
indued w<sup>t</sup> his vestymentes for to solemnyse the matrymonye.
The knyght had the quene all redy apparayled in his owne
house after his maner &#8266;
had ordeyned two knyghtes for to
lede her to the chyrche, they byleuynge that it had ben his
paramour. And whan they were before in the face of y<sup>e</sup>
chyrche y<sup>e</sup> preest sayd, who shall gyue this woman vnto this

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>

knyght. Then the ky<i>n</i>ge sayd, I shall gyue her to myn owne
knyght. and toke her by the hande &#8266; sayd vnto her, O good
woman ye are moche lyke vnto my quene, and therfore I loue
you the better, and also for that ye be my knyghtes wyfe and
shall be of my house. and putte the quenes hande in to y<sup>e</sup>
knyghtes hand. and y<sup>e</sup> preest after y<sup>e</sup> maner of the chyrche
hath bounde &#8266; wedded them togyder. and whan all this was
fynysshed &#8266; done the knyghte sayd vnto y<sup>e</sup> kyng, Syr my shyp
y<sup>t</sup> I entende to go in towardes my countre is all redy to make
sayle wherfore I humbly beseche hyghly your moost noble
grace that it wyl please you for to accompany my wy[fe]
therunto &#8266; that ye wyll aduertyse &#8266; enfourme her<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that
she loue me &#8266; haue me in fauoure aboue all other creatures
lyuynge, and the rather for your gode excytacyon &#8266; doctryne.
Thenne the kynge with a grete multytude of people
went with theym &#8266; accompanyed theym vnto the shyppe of
whoos departynge many of them were dolaunte to the shyppe.
the kynge began to say vnto the quene, my moost dere frende,
herken now well vnto my counseyll and folowe it, for it shall
be for your honour &#8266; proufyte. My knyght hath now here
wedded &#8266; done to you al ye worshypp y<sup>t</sup> in hym is. wherfore
loke y<sup>t</sup> ye loue &#8266; honour hym aboue all erthly creatures &#8266; y<sup>t</sup>
hath god commaunded &#8266; that ye be too hym true &#8266; obedyent.
&#8266; as this was sayd he delyuered her vnto y<sup>e</sup> knyght saynge my

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>

blessyng go w<sup>t</sup> you both, &#8266; our lorde kepe &#8266; conduyte you in
sauete to your cou<i>n</i>tre. Then the knyght and the quene bowed
and enclyned down&#772; her hedes vnto y<sup>e</sup> kynge. &#8266; thanked hym
of all thyngs and they commytted hym to god and entred in
to the shyppe and the maryners haled up the sayles and sayled
forth afore the wynde soo that w<sup>t</sup>in a short tyme the kyng
had lost y<sup>e</sup> syght of the shyp. And from the<i>n</i>s he went hastely
to y<sup>e</sup> castell &#8266; myssed the quene. &#8266; wha<i>n</i> he founde her not / he
was meued in all the partes of his body. &#8266; sought all about y<sup>e</sup>
toure and serched, tyll at laste he founde y<sup>e</sup> hole or y<sup>e</sup> secrete
way y<sup>t</sup> the knyght had made. &#8266; as he saw that, than cryed he
and weped and sayd, Alas alas this knyght in whom I hadde so
grete confydence &#8266; truste hath taken away my wyfe, was I not
a fole y<sup>t</sup> I gaue more fayth in to his words then I dyde to
myne owne eyen. Than sayd thempresse, My lorde haue ye
vnderstand what I haue sayde. Themperour sayd ryght wel
in y<sup>e</sup> best wyse. Then sayd thempresse, remember how y<sup>t</sup>
he trusted the knyghte &#8266; yet he deceyued hy<i>m</i>. In the same
manere wyse ye haue confydence in the seuen wyse maysters /
and they laboure for to destroye me that am your wyfe. &#8266; ye
gyue more fayth vnto theyr wordes than ye do vnto your owne
eyen. for ye haue well sene how y<sup>t</sup> youre sone rente and
scratched me. Wherof yet I bere and haue the tokens &#8266; the
markes as ye may see. And also ye knowe well how that your
cursed sone hath me ashamed &#8266; ye marke not howe they
defende hym in his foly and falshede. Therfore it is to be

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>

dradde y<sup>t</sup> it shall happen to you as it dyde to the kynge that
too you I haue spoken of. Themperour sayd, I byleue myn
eyen better than theyr wordes. &#8266; therfore I say you y<sup>t</sup> to
morowe I shall do justyce of hym. On y<sup>e</sup> morowe the Emperour
commaunded that his sone sholde be hanged. Tho
began ayen a grete noyse in and [bewailing amongst the
common people for the death of the Emperor's only son. At
last when the seventh master heard it, he ran immediately
unto the officers, which were leading him to the gallows, and
said: My friends, I pray you not to make overmuch haste
but stay your hands a while, for I think this day (with the
help of the Almighty God) to save him from all perils; and
from thence the master hasteth himself to the Emperor's
Palace, and did him reverence according to his accustomed
duty. But the Emperor with great indignation made him
this answer: Never more have you any joy in this world, for
that you have sent my son home untaught and dumb, whom
I delivered unto you well speaking, for which cause you shall
all be put to death with him. The master answered: O
most noble Emperor, the time is not long betwixt this and tomorrow
noon; then (by the grace of God) you shall hear
him speak discreetly, and shall declare the truth of all things,
and this I promise you he will perform to the full, upon pain of
my life, if you will spare him so long a time; if you find it not
so, then take my life and the lives of us all. Then said the
Emperor: If I might but hear my son speak, it would give me

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>

sufficient content, and I would not desire longer to live. Then
answered the master: All this and more you shall hear and
see, and confess it to be true, if you will but abide this little
time: and then the strife that hath been betwixt us and the
Empress will clearly be decided. And if you suffer him to be
put to death through the words of your most ungodly wife,
I tell you of a truth it shall happen worse to you than it did
to a knight that died for a little blood that he saw his wife to
bleed, to whom afterwards she was most unnatural. Then
said the Emperor: That example I would fain hear. Then
said the master: Let your son be called again, and I shall tell
you so notable an example that during your life you may
beware of the unsteadfastness of woman. Then the Emperor
said: I shall go call my son again upon condition that tomorrow
I shall hear him speak as you have promised. The
master said: Do that, my lord, for it shall so be. And began
to tell as followeth.]</p>

it sholde be to me a grete rebuke, yf I c&#333;mytted soo dysloyall
a dede vnto his body beynge dede. She answered for your loue
I shall do it, &#8266; toke a stone &#8266; smote out two of his tethe, &#8266;
sayd to the shyref, take hy<i>m</i> &#8266; hange him vpon y<sup>e</sup> galowes lyke

Then sayd she, I sawe neuer so feerfull a man seyng y<sup>e</sup> mater
so clere &#8266; sure. Take a knyfe &#8266; cut of his stones. And he
answered, y<sup>t</sup> may I not do in no wyse and therfore I pray you

And went forth togyder and henge vp the body vpo<i>n</i> y<sup>e</sup> galowes

caused money to be thrown into the streets, that the people
therwith should be busied out of the palace, the better to
hear the child speak; but they regarded not the money.
When the emperor perceived that he commanded silence on
pain of death. And when they were all still, the child began
to speak as followeth: O most dear father, before I speak
anything, I entreat you that the empress with all her chamber-maids
may be present. So the emperor commanded the
empress with all her maids to come without delay. The
empress hearing that (in great fear) came with her maids;
and the child bade them to stand before the people in a row
that he might see them. Then said the child, Sir, behold
the chamber-maid that standeth there in green (whom ye

be uncloathed before us all, and see what she is. The emperor
said, Dear son, that would shame us all, to have a woman

Empresse that I wolde also by y<sup>e</sup> helpe of my maysters depose

I not holde you for my fader. God defende that, for of you
I haue my lyuyng. And I shall holde and repute you for my

coude shew the interpretacyon therof. Thenne the sone

of theyr folowynge, &#8266; can shewe what they mene by theyr
cryenge &#8266; voyde theym fro me, w<sup>t</sup>out doubte I shall fulfyll this
promyse y<sup>t</sup> I haue made. &#8266; as the kynge had thus sayd, there
was none fou<i>n</i>de in all the cou<i>n</i>seyll y<sup>t</sup> wyst the cause or coude
moue or put awaye the rauons. Then sayd y<sup>e</sup> chylde too the
duke. My lorde thynke ye that the kynge wyl holde his promyse
or worde yf I accomplysshe his wyll and desyre. Than
y<sup>e</sup> duke sayde I thynke he wyll holde y<sup>t</sup> he hath promysed, but
wyl ye y<sup>t</sup> I gyue the kynge knowledge of you what ye can do.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>

Then y<sup>e</sup> chylde sayd, I wyl my lyfe set in pledge &#8266; I shall
perfourme &#8266; make it good y<sup>t</sup> I haue sayd. Whan y<sup>e</sup> duke
herde that he went to the kynge &#8266; sayd, My lorde the kyng,
here is a yong ma<i>n</i> that is ryght connynge &#8266; wyse, the whiche
promyseth for to satysfye &#8266; fulfyl in al thy<i>n</i>ges your desyre as
touchy<i>n</i>ge the rauons yf ye wyll fulfyll that ye haue promysed.
The kynge swore by the crowne of his kyngdome, what I haue
promysed in al thynges shalbe fulfylled. Tho brought he y<sup>e</sup>
chylde before the kynge, and whan the kynge sawe hym he
spake to hym. O fayre chylde can ye gyue answere to my
questyon. The chylde sayd, my lorde ye in the best wyse,
your questyon is wherfore y<sup>t</sup> the rauons folowe you &#8266; horrybly
crye vpon you. To whiche I answere. Upon a tyme it
hapned that two rauons a male &#8266; a female had brought forthe
bytwene them the thyrde rauon. vpon the sayd se was so
grete famyne &#8266; scarsytee of all maner of thy<i>n</i>ges y<sup>t</sup> men bestes
&#8266; foules dyed &#8266; perysshed for defaute. The thyrde rauon y<sup>t</sup>
tyme beynge yonge in the nest the moder lefte it sekynge
where she myght best gete her lyuynge, &#8266; came no more to
y<sup>e</sup> neste. The male rauon seynge that with grete penurye and
laboure fed the yong rauon tyll that he was able to flye and
wha<i>n</i> the dere tyde was passed and gone then the female rauon
came ayen too the yonge rauon and wolde holde felysshyppe
and company with hym. And as the male rauon sawe that,
he wolde haue dryuen her away, saynge thus, that she in his
grete myscheyf and necessyte lefte hym and his company, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>

therfore nowe she sholde wante his company and felysshyppe.
She alledged and sayd that she had in his byrthe grete laboure
and sorowe, and suffred penurye, and therfore of his company
she sholde rather joye than the fader. For this my souerayne
lorde they folowe you askynge the ryght jugement whiche of
them both shal haue the yonge rauon in theyr company, and
this is the cause of theyr horryble clamour and noyse that they
make dayly vpon you. But my lorde hadde ye hereupon a
ryght wysse sentence gyuen ye sholde neuer more see theym
or be troubled w<sup>t</sup> theyr cryenge. Tho sayd the kynge, for the
cause that the moder hath left &#8266; forsaken the yonge rauen in
his mooste necessyte, it standeth with reason &#8266; iustyce y<sup>t</sup> she
shall wante &#8266; be without his felyshyp. And where y<sup>t</sup> she
sayth &#8266; alledgethe y<sup>t</sup> in the berynge &#8266; byrth of hym she hadde
greate payne and traueyle, that helpeth her not, for y<sup>t</sup> payne
was torned in to joye as sone as she sawe the yonge rauen
in the worlde. But for y<sup>t</sup> the male is y<sup>e</sup> cause of produccyon
&#8266; generacyon in euery beste, &#8266; also y<sup>t</sup> he the yong rauon
in his necessyte sustayned &#8266; fedde in to the recoueryng &#8266;
nourysshynge of his body, therfore I gyue for a iugement
&#8266; for a sentence dyffinityue y<sup>t</sup> the yonge rauen shall abyde
&#8266; holde company w<sup>t</sup> the fader and not with the moder.
And whan the rauons herde this sentence, with a greate
noyse &#8266; crye they flewe vp in the ayre &#8266; were no more
seen ne fou<i>n</i>de in all that Regyon. Whanne that this was
doone y<sup>e</sup> kynge demaunded of the yonge man what his name

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span>

was. He answered I am called Alexander. Tho sayd the
kynge, I wyll haue one thynge of you, y<sup>t</sup> ye frome hens forth
shal name &#8266; take me &#8266; none other for your fader but me, for
ye shall marye my doughter, and ye shall be possessour of all
my realme. The yonge Alexander abode and dwelled stylle
with the kynge, and euery man hadde too hym fauour and loue,
for he began to haunt and occupy hymselfe in iustes &#8266; in
tourneys, wherin at all tymes he had the pryse aboue all other
y<sup>t</sup> were in all Egypte, soo y<sup>t</sup> his pere or lyke was not founde, &#8266;
there was not so harde nor so obscure a questyon put vnto hym
but y<sup>t</sup> he coude assoyle it. At that tyme was there an Emperoure
named Tytus, that excelled in gentylnesse, curtesy &#8266;
curposyte [curiosity] of all other Emperours kynges and prynces
in y<sup>e</sup> worlde. In so moche y<sup>t</sup> suche a fame &#8266; noyse flewe &#8266;
ranne ouer all the worlde of it, y<sup>t</sup> what so euer he was y<sup>t</sup> wolde
prouffyte in connynge maners or behauynge, that he sholde go
to the Emperours courte. And whan Alexander herd that he
sayd to the kynge my most honourable fader &#8266; lorde ye wote
well that al the worlde is full of the fame of themperoure so y<sup>t</sup>
it is delectable to abide &#8266; dwel in hys courte wherfore yf it
please yow my lorde &#8266; fader I wolde gladly go to hys court that
I myght be wyser &#8266; prompter in maners &#8266; behauy<i>n</i>ge than I
am. Thereupon answered y<sup>e</sup> kynge, It pleaseth me ryght
well, but I wolde that ye take with you plente of golde &#8266;
syluer &#8266; other necessaryes, so moche y<sup>t</sup> ye myn honoure ther
w<sup>t</sup> may saue, &#8266; y<sup>t</sup> ye may haue also y<sup>t</sup> is to you requysyte &#8266;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>

behouefull. And also me semeth it were expedyent y<sup>t</sup> ye afore
your departyng sholde mary my doughter. Tho answerd
Alexander wyll it please you my lorde too spare me at this tyme
&#8266; at my comynge home ayen I shall wedde hir w<sup>t</sup> all honoure
as to her apperteyneth. The kynge answered, sythen it is your
wyll to go to themperours court I lycence you and therto I
consente. Alexander toke leue of the kynge, &#8266; toke with hym
tresoure ynoughe &#8266; went to themperours courte. And whan
he was come with a fayre companye, he wente afore the
Emperoure &#8266; felle on his knees, and salued hym &#8266; dyd hym
reuerence. Themperoure rose frome his sete imperyall and
kyssed hym, &#8266; asked of hym of whens &#8266; what he was, &#8266;
wherfore he was comen. He answered and sayd I am sone &#8266;
heyre to the kynge of Egypte, &#8266; am come to do seruyce to
your moost hyghe maieste yf it please you to accepte me.
Themperour sayd y<sup>t</sup> he was ryght welcome, &#8266; c&#333;mytted hym
to his stewarde and made hym his keruer. The stewarde
ordeyned hym a fayre chamber &#8266; purueyed hym all thynges y<sup>t</sup>
were necessary to the same. And Alexander behaued hym so
well &#8266; wysely y<sup>t</sup> in shorte tyme of all people he was beloued.
Not longe after that came y<sup>e</sup> kynges sone of Fraunce to do
seruyse to themperoure &#8266; to lerne nurture, whome themperour
receyued honourably and demau<i>n</i>ded his name &#8266; of what kynred
he was come. He answered I am sone to the kynge of
Frau<i>n</i>ce, &#8266; I haue to name Lodwyke your seruau<i>n</i>te. Tho
sayd the Emperoure I haue made Alexander my karuer, &#8266; ye

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>

shall be my cuppe berer. y<sup>t</sup> alwayes ye shall do seruyse afore
me at my table. &#8266; c&#333;mau<i>n</i>ded his stewarde to assygne hym a
lodgynge, whome he assygned w<sup>t</sup> Alexander in his chamber.
These were soo lyke in stature, in vysage, &#8266; in condycyons y<sup>t</sup>
vnneth y<sup>e</sup> one myght be dyscerned fro y<sup>e</sup> other. but y<sup>t</sup> Alexander
was more in c&#333;nyng &#8266; lyghtlyer in his dedes than Lodwyke
was, for Lodwyke was a femynyne man &#8266; shamfast. &#8266;
these two yong men loued well togyder. This Emperoure
had a doughter oonly, named Florentyne, y<sup>e</sup> which was ryght
fayr &#8266; gracyous, &#8266; shold be his heyre whome he loued entyerly,
which had a courte by her selfe &#8266; seruau<i>n</i>tes to her
assygned. To whome y<sup>e</sup> Emperour euery daye was accustomed
to sende frome his table of his deyntes, in tokenyng of
loue by y<sup>e</sup> hande of Alexander, wherupon y<sup>e</sup> doughter began
to haue hym meruaylouslye in her fauoure bycause of his wysdome
&#8266; his gracyous demenure. It hapned vpon a day Alexander
at the mete tyme had suche a besynesse y<sup>t</sup> he serued not
at y<sup>e</sup> table nor none other gaue attendau<i>n</i>ce for hym in his
rowme. Lodwyke perceyued y<sup>t</sup> &#8266; serued in his stede. And
whan he had serued the Emperoure in his last seruyce vpon
his knee, y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure c&#333;mau<i>n</i>ded hy<i>m</i> to bere a dysshe vnto
his doughter as he was wonte to do, thynkyng hym to be
Alexander. Tho toke Lodwyke y<sup>e</sup> dysshe &#8266; yede to y<sup>e</sup> palays
of the Emperours doughter &#8266; salued her w<sup>t</sup> grete reuerence &#8266;
set y<sup>e</sup> mete afore her. but vnto y<sup>t</sup> tyme he had not seen her
she perceyued anone y<sup>t</sup> it was not Alexander, &#8266; sayd to hym

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>

in this manere. What is your name, &#8266; whose sone are ye.
&#8266; he answered to hyr &#8266; sayd, Madame I am y<sup>e</sup> kynges sone
of Frau<i>n</i>ce, &#8266; my name is Lodwyke. She sayd I thanke you
of your laboure. &#8266; he toke his leue &#8266; departed. In y<sup>e</sup> mene
tyme came Alexander to y<sup>e</sup> table, &#8266; they fulfylled ther seruyce.
The dyner done anone Lodwyke went to his bedde sore seke.
And Alexander apperceyuynge that went to his chamber &#8266;
sayd to hym, O my best beloued frende &#8266; felowe Lodwyke
how is it with you, &#8266; what is y<sup>e</sup> cause of your infyrmite. He
answered hym and sayd, y<sup>e</sup> cause of it I knowe not but I fele
me soo seke y<sup>t</sup> I fere me I can not escape y<sup>e</sup> dethe. Alexander
sayd y<sup>e</sup> cause of your infyrmyte and dysease I knowe well.
For to daye whan as ye bare the mete vnto the Emperours
doughter, ye behelde hyr vysage &#8266; beaute so feruently, y<sup>t</sup> your
herte is taken &#8266; rauysshed w<sup>t</sup> her loue. Therupon he answered,
O Alexander all the physysyans in the worlde coude
not more truly iuge my sekenesse, but I fere it shall be my
dethe. Then sayd Alexander, Be of good comforth and I
shall helpe you vnto my power, &#8266; yede vnto the market &#8266;
bought w<sup>t</sup> his owne moneye a fayre clothe sette with precyous
stones, vnknowynge to Lodwyke &#8266; presented it on his behalue
vnto the mayden. &#8266; as she sawe y<sup>t</sup> she asked hym where he
myght that costely &#8266; precyouse cloth fynde to bye. &#8266; he
sayd, Madame it is the sone of y<sup>e</sup> moost crysten kynge y<sup>t</sup>
sendeth it vnto you for youre loue, for he but for one syght y<sup>t</sup>
he hathe had of you is so seke y<sup>t</sup> he lyeth vpon his bed vnto the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>

dethe. &#8266; therfore yf ye suffre hym to perysshe ye shall neuer
recouer ayen your honoure. Tho sayd she, O Alexander
wolde ye this cou<i>n</i>seyll me y<sup>t</sup> I shold soo lese my vyrgynyte.
God defende that. &#8266; be ye sure Alexander y<sup>t</sup> of suche messages
ye shall neuer more haue ne wyn thanke. Therfore go ye out
of my syght &#8266; speke no more therof to me. whanne Alexander
herde that he dyd his obeysaunce and departed. y<sup>e</sup> nexte daye
Alexander went ayen to the cyte &#8266; bought a chaplet that was
two tymes more in value than y<sup>e</sup> cloth, and therwith he yede
to y<sup>e</sup> maydens chamber &#8266; yaue it to hyr on the behalue of
Lodwyke. And whan she sawe that costely gyfte she sayd
vnto hym in this manere. I marueyle of you y<sup>t</sup> soo oftentymes
as ye haue seen and spoken with me, that ye haue not done
your owne erande or spoken for your selfe but for an other.
Then he answered, O madame I haue not ben so disposed, by
cause that my byrthe is not to be compared with yours. And
also it happened me neuer suche a case that my herte was so
wounded, &#8266; he y<sup>t</sup> hathe a gode felawe is bou<i>n</i>de for to doo hym
good &#8266; true felysshyp. And therfore moost eccellent pryncesse
of youre moost habundau<i>n</i>te pyte haue compassyon vpon hym &#8266;
make hym hole that ye haue se wou<i>n</i>ded vnto y<sup>e</sup> deth that it be
not for euer layde vnto your crueltee &#8266; impyteouse herte. She
answered hym, go your wayes for at this tyme I wyll gyue you
none answere therof. And as he herde y<sup>t</sup> he toke his leue &#8266;
departed. And the thyrde daye he wente vnto the market &#8266;
boughte a gyrdell y<sup>t</sup> thre tymes was more in value &#8266; costelyer

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>

than the chaplet was, &#8266; presented it vnto her on the behalue of
Lodwyke. And whan she sawe &#8266; behelde y<sup>t</sup> so precyouse, she
sayd vnto Alexander, Saye to Lodwyke y<sup>t</sup> he come to my
chamber aboute y<sup>e</sup> thyrde hour in y<sup>e</sup> nyght, and he shall fynde
y<sup>e</sup> dore open. &#8266; Alexander herynge that, he was glad, &#8266;
went to his felow and sayd, My beste beloued felowe be ye of
gode comforth, for I haue conquered y<sup>e</sup> mayden vnto you, and
in this nyght I shall brynge you vnto hyr chamber. And whan
y<sup>t</sup> was sayd, he stert vp as thoughe that he hadde wakened out
of his slepe, &#8266; was well reuyued &#8266; for grete ioye he was made all
hole. And y<sup>e</sup> next nyght folowynge Alexander toke Lodwyke
&#8266; brought hym vnto the chamber of y<sup>e</sup> lady w<sup>t</sup> whome he was
in solace &#8266; joye all the nyght, &#8266; fro y<sup>t</sup> tyme forth all hyr herte
was vpon hym so y<sup>t</sup> there was but one loue betwyxt them bothe.
And after y<sup>t</sup> Lodwyke vsed her oftentymes to vysyte. So y<sup>t</sup>
it came by processe of tyme to the eres of y<sup>e</sup> knyghtes of ye
courte, how y<sup>t</sup> the Emperours doughter was knowen by Lodwyke:
&#8266; conspyred amonges them selfe how y<sup>t</sup> they myght
hym therwith all fynde, &#8266; hym to take or sle. As Alexander
had knowlege therof, he armed hym to withstande them.
And whan the knyghtes vnderstode y<sup>t</sup> they ferynge Alexander
suffred his felowe to go in peas, &#8266; Alexander many tymes put
hym selfe in ieopardye for hym, he not knowynge therof, but
y<sup>e</sup> mayde knewe it welle. In shorte tyme after y<sup>t</sup> there came
letters to Alexander of the dethe of the kynge of Egypt y<sup>t</sup> he
sholde hastely come and receyue his kyngdome with honour &#8266;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>

joye, and that shewed he anone too the mayden and to Lodwyke.
and also of his departynge, wherof they were sorowfull &#8266;
heuy. he sayd also vnto y<sup>e</sup> emperour, My mooste redoubted
lorde please it you for to vnderstande that I haue receyued
letters of the deth of my fader. Wherfore it behoueth
me to go &#8266; receyue y<sup>e</sup> kyngdome, and that ye wyll lycence
me to depart, and for all benefetes to [me] done I offre
my selfe &#8266; all my godes, &#8266; rather then I sholde by my
goynge awaye offende or dysplese you my lorde I shall
forsake all my realme &#8266; all y<sup>t</sup> I haue in y<sup>e</sup> world, &#8266; abyde w<sup>t</sup>
you styll. Then sayd y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure, knowe ye for certayne
y<sup>t</sup> of your departynge I am ryght heuy for ye were vnto me
the beste seruau<i>n</i>t that was in all my house. But it becometh
not an Emperoure to lette his seruauntes frome ther promocyons,
or auau<i>n</i>cementes, but soner to promote theym vnto
hygher &#8266; gretter honoure. Therfore go ye vnto oure tresourer,
&#8266; he shall delyuer you as moche golde as ye wyll haue,
&#8266; in y<sup>e</sup> name of god &#8266; with my blessynge go in to your cou<i>n</i>tre.
and thus Alexander had leue of y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure &#8266; bad farewell,
&#8266; many of y<sup>e</sup> courte were sorowfull of his departynge, for
of all he was beloued. Lodwyke w<sup>t</sup> the mayden brought hym
on his waye well seuen myle. After that Alexander wolde
not suffre theym for to go further. then fell they both to y<sup>e</sup>
grou<i>n</i>de for grete sorow &#8266; Alexander toke &#8266; lyfte them bothe vp
ayen from y<sup>e</sup> erthe, &#8266; comforted theym with fayre &#8266; swete
wordes and sayd, O Lodwyke my moost beloued felawe, I

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>

warne you y<sup>t</sup> the secretes beynge betwyxt you &#8266; my lady, ye
hyde them &#8266; kepe them as preuely as ye may &#8266; take good
hede to all thynges, for I wote an other shall come and be in
my stede, that shall enuy you of the fauoure &#8266; grace, y<sup>t</sup> ye
stande in w<sup>t</sup> the Emperoure and daye &#8266; nyght shall lye in a
wayte to take you w<sup>t</sup> a faute, &#8266; to put you to a rebuke. Then
answered Lodwyke &#8266; sayd, O Alexander I shall be ware as
moche as to me is possyble, but how shall I nowe do whan I
wante your company, therfore one thynge I shall desyre of you
y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> wyl take this rynge of me for a reme<i>m</i>brau<i>n</i>ce. Then sayd
he I shall for the loue of you gladly receyue y<sup>e</sup> rynge, &#8266; yet
sholde I neuer w<sup>t</sup>oute y<sup>e</sup> rynge forgete you, &#8266; comytted them
too god. Then they embraced eche other aboute y<sup>e</sup> necke &#8266;
kyssed, and so departed frome other. Not longe after y<sup>t</sup> the
kynges sone of Spayne named Guydo was receyued of the
Emperoure in y<sup>e</sup> rowme &#8266; place of Alexander, to whome the
stewarde assygned Alexander's place &#8266; chamber, whiche was
sore ayenste y<sup>e</sup> wyll of Lodwyke, but he coude not amende it.
Guydo perceyuynge y<sup>t</sup> Lodwyke ayenst his wyll had hym in
his felysshyp, anone he toke &#8266; had enuye ayenst hym so that
Lodwyke of a longe tyme for fere of ye sayd Guydo kepte hym
out of y<sup>e</sup> company of y<sup>e</sup> sayd mayde. Neuerthelesse afterwarde
ouercomen with the loue of y<sup>e</sup> mayden, somtyme hau<i>n</i>ted &#8266;
wente ayen to hyr as he afore tyme had done. Guydo shortly
perceyuynge awayted so longe therupon, y<sup>t</sup> he the trouthe
knewe, and was therof in surete that the mayden was by Lodwyke

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>

knowen &#8266; hadde accompanyed with hym. Uppon a
tyme it happened y<sup>t</sup> the Emperoure stode in hys halle &#8266; praysed
gretely Alexander of his gentylnes and wysedome. That
herynge Guydo sayde, My lorde he is not soo moche worthy
to be c&#333;mended as ye wene for he hath ben a longe whyle a
traytour in youre house. Thenne themperoure sayd telle me
how. Guydo sayd, ye haue but one doughter oonly, y<sup>e</sup> whiche
shall be your heyre, and y<sup>t</sup> Lodwyke hathe defouled &#8266; lyen by
hyr by the helpe of Alexander: &#8266; he gothe to hyr euery nyght
whan it pleaseth hym. and whan y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure herde y<sup>t</sup>
he was sore meuyd &#8266; wexed angry, &#8266; it happened Lodwyke
vpon y<sup>e</sup> same tyme to come thrugh y<sup>e</sup> hall and whan the Emperour
sawe hym he sayd, what hear I of ye thou euyll and
vntrue body. Yf it be founde &#8266; proued true thou shalt deye
y<sup>e</sup> moost shamefull dethe y<sup>t</sup> cann be deuysed. Lodwyke sayd,
My lorde y<sup>e</sup> emperoure what is y<sup>e</sup> cause. Guydo answered, I
saye &#8266; depose here afore my lorde ayenst the y<sup>t</sup> thou haste
defouled his oonly doughter. &#8266; euery nyght thou goost to hyr
&#8266; doost fornycacyon w<sup>t</sup> her, and y<sup>t</sup> in batayle I shall proue &#8266;
make good vpon thy body w<sup>t</sup> my body. Thenne sayd Lodwyke
I am innocente, &#8266; not defectyue in y<sup>e</sup> cryme, &#8266; falsely y<sup>u</sup>
puttest y<sup>t</sup> and layest vpon me, &#8266; therupon I holde y<sup>e</sup> batayle,
for I truste on god thy falshede shall come vpon thyn owne
hede. Then y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure assygned theym the daye of batayle
&#8266; fyghtynge. That done Lodwyke went vnto y<sup>e</sup> mayden &#8266;
shewed to her y<sup>e</sup> cause &#8266; the daye of batayle by the Emperoure

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>

assygned and in what maner Guydo hadde hym accused, and
sayd to hyr, Nowe it behoueth me to haue your cou<i>n</i>seyll, or
els I muste deye for why as ye knowe it had not aueyled me to
haue a-yensayd the batayle w<sup>t</sup>out I wolde haue yelded myselfe
gylty. Guydo is stronge &#8266; hardy in armes that his lyke is none
but Alexander, &#8266; I am weyke &#8266; feble &#8266; therfore yf I holde
the batayle ayenst hym I am but a dede man, &#8266; so shall ye
abyde shamed &#8266; rebuked. Then sayd she, Do my cou<i>n</i>seyle in
that, y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> mystrust youre selfe. Go hastely vnto my fader, &#8266;
saye to hym that ye haue receyued letters, wherby that ye are
acertayned that y<sup>e</sup> lorde your fader is sore seke &#8266; lyeth vppon
his dede bed &#8266; desyreth to se you &#8266; speke w<sup>t</sup> youre persone, &#8266;
to dyspose his kyngdome &#8266; his godes afore he departe out of this
world, &#8266; desyre his lycence for the loue of your fader y<sup>t</sup> ye
maye go &#8266; vysite hym. &#8266; y<sup>t</sup> he wyll proroge &#8266; lengthe the daye
of bataylle whyles y<sup>t</sup> ye maye go &#8266; come. And whan ye haue
obteyned his congye or lycence, as hastely as ye may go
secretely to the kynge Alexander, &#8266; whan ye are come to hym
take hym aparte &#8266; shewe hym y<sup>e</sup> cause of youre comynge &#8266;
requyre hym in this youre vtter extremyte y<sup>t</sup> he wylle vs helpe
&#8266; ayde. And whan y<sup>t</sup> Lodwyke had herd this cou<i>n</i>seyll, it
pleased hym well &#8266; dyde hereafter. Hys leue goten &#8266; lenger
daye or terme of batayle prefyxed and assygned departed &#8266; toke
his iourneye towardes y<sup>e</sup> realme of Egypte, &#8266; neuer letted daye
nor nyght tyll he came vnto kynge Alexander's castell. &#8266; whan
y<sup>e</sup> kynge Alexander hadde vnderstondynge of his comynge he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>

was moche glad &#8266; went to mete hym &#8266; receyued him honourably,
&#8266; had wonder of his comyn&#772;ge. Tho sayd Lodwyke, O
my dere lorde &#8266; my bestebyloued frende, my lyfe &#8266; my dethe is
in youre handes, for as ye sayd to me afore y<sup>t</sup> I sholde haue an
other felowe y<sup>e</sup> whiche sholde lye in a wayte to aspye me &#8266;

as longe as I myght I absented me tyll y<sup>t</sup> I coude no lenger.
But afterwarde y<sup>e</sup> kynges sone of Spayne makynge watch soo
longe on me tyll that he perceyued y<sup>e</sup> trouthe, &#8266; hathe accused
me vnto y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure, so that frome this daye vnto y<sup>e</sup> viii.
daye hereafter prefyxed it behoueth me to come &#8266; fyght w<sup>t</sup> hym
body ayenst body, and as ye knowe well he is a stronge &#8266; an
hardy man, and I am weyke &#8266; feble, &#8266; therfore hath Florentyne
cou<i>n</i>seyled me y<sup>t</sup> I sholde not hyde this my charge frome you
for she knoweth you for a faythfull frende, &#8266; that y<sup>e</sup> wolde
not leue vs in this necessyte. Then sayd Alexander, is there ony
body y<sup>t</sup> knoweth of your comyng vnto me for this mater more
than Florentyne. He answered hym &#8266; sayd no creature lyuynge,
for I toke leue of y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure to go &#8266; vysite my fader lyenge
greuously seke. Then axed Alexander hym what cou<i>n</i>seyll hathe
Florentyne gyuen to you howe &#8266; in what wyse I myght helpe
you. He sayd, O moost constau<i>n</i>t &#8266; faythfull frende, in this
wyse she hath cou<i>n</i>seylled me, co<i>n</i>syderynge y<sup>t</sup> we be lyke, y<sup>t</sup> ye
sholde come &#8266; do ye batayle wyth hym, no man shall knowe
you but she, and the batayll done I shall come ayen to y<sup>e</sup>
court &#8266; ye vnto youre cou<i>n</i>tree. Then he asked whan y<sup>e</sup> day

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>

sholde be of the batayle, and he sayd this daye, viii. dayes.
Thenne sayd Alexander, yf I sholde this daye tary then can I
not come to y<sup>t</sup> daye prefyxed. Therfore se what I shall do.
I haue boden all my subgectes that tomorowe they sholde come
&#8266; be at my weddynge &#8266; brydale. and yf I sholde go than is
y<sup>t</sup> daye loste / and yf I go not &#8266; do the batayle than Florentyne
&#8266; ye are bothe vndone. what thynke ye nowe beste for to doo.
whan Lodwyke herde y<sup>t</sup> he fell to the erthe &#8266; began to syghe
&#8266; sorowe oute of mesure, saynge, sorow and heuynesse come
to me on all sydes. Then sayd Alexander vnto hym, be of
good comforte for I shall not forsake you thus, thoughe that
I sholde lese my wyf &#8266; kyngdome but herken what that I haue
thought in so moche as we are bothe lyke: soo y<sup>t</sup> the one of

&#8266; I am not yet gretly knowen here. but my barons &#8266; other
folke shall take you for me. Therfore here shall ye abyde &#8266;
tary &#8266; mary my wyfe in my stede, &#8266; holde y<sup>e</sup> feest &#8266; brydale,
&#8266; do in all thynges as though I were there my selfe present,
excepte whan as ye come to bedde w<sup>t</sup> my wyfe loke y<sup>t</sup> ye be

badde Lodwyke fare well, and toke his journeye towardes y<sup>e</sup>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>

Guydo. &#8266; Lodwyke abode in Egypt in the stede of kynge
Alexander, and vpon the next mornynge came Lodwyke as
though it hadde be kynge Alexander. &#8266; solemply in y<sup>e</sup> face
of the chirche maryed and spoused Alexander's wyfe, &#8266; helde
y<sup>e</sup> feest and brydale w<sup>t</sup> grete royalte of delycate, &#8266; precyous
metes, plente of all maner wynes, &#8266; dyuerse melodyes of instrumentes
of musyke, and he made greate joye &#8266; chere to all the
noble men, &#8266; to all other people y<sup>t</sup> there was assembled. And
whan y<sup>e</sup> nyghte was come, he wente to bedde with y<sup>e</sup> quene,
&#8266; layd betwyxt hym and her a naked swerde, wherof she had
greate wonder, but no thynge she sayd, and also he laye w<sup>t</sup> hir
euery nyght as longe as Alexander was out. &#182; The kynge
Alexander at the daye y<sup>t</sup> was prefixed &#8266; sette, came vnto y<sup>e</sup>
Emperoure &#8266; sayd, O most drad souerayne lorde it is so y<sup>t</sup> I
haue left my fader ryght seke. Neuerthelesse I am come for
to defende myn honoure &#8266; my forwarde to performe. The
Emperoure sayd ye do ryght well &#8266; accordynge to a noble
man, &#8266; fortune shall fauoure you in your iuste &#8266; ryght wysse
quarell. And whan the Emperours doughter vnderstode y<sup>t</sup>
Alexander was comen, anone she sent for him &#8266; whan as he
was come to hyr she embraced hym, &#8266; with ioye &#8266; gladnesse
she kyste hym, &#8266; blessed y<sup>e</sup> tyme that she myght see hym ayen
&#8266; demau<i>n</i>ded hym where he that hadde lefte hyr frende and
louer Lodwyke. Then he shewed &#8266; declared vnto hyr all y<sup>e</sup>
processe &#8266; how he had left hym kyng in his realme, &#8266; toke his
leue at hyr, &#8266; wente in to Lodwyke's chamber, &#8266; there was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>

no creature y<sup>t</sup> thought otherwyse but it was lodwyke, oonly
excepte Florentyne. The next daye folowynge afore er Alexander
went vnto y<sup>e</sup> batayle he sayd vnto y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure in y<sup>e</sup>
presence of Guydo. My moost redoubted souerayne lord this
Guydo hath falsely &#8266; vntruely accused me vnto your noble
grace, y<sup>t</sup> I sholde be of suche aqueyntau<i>n</i>ce w<sup>t</sup> youre doughter
y<sup>t</sup> sholde be vnto y<sup>e</sup> dyshonoure of your moost noble persone &#8266;
hyrs, &#8266; vnto y<sup>t</sup> I swere &#8266; afferme, by this holy euau<i>n</i>gelyes y<sup>t</sup>
she was neuer in ony maner by me in suche wyse knowen as
he hathe to you alledged &#8266; enformed, &#8266; that this daye w<sup>t</sup> the
ayde &#8266; y<sup>e</sup> helpe of god I shall proue &#8266; make good vppon his
body. Then sayd Guydo, yet ones I say ayen &#8266; swere by y<sup>e</sup>
holy euaungelyes &#8266; by all y<sup>t</sup> god hathe made y<sup>t</sup> thou hast hadde
knowledge &#8266; hast defouled y<sup>e</sup> Emperours doughter, &#8266; y<sup>t</sup> I shall
make good vpon thy hede. where vpon they lepte vpon theyr
coursers, &#8266; fyersly ranne togyder w<sup>t</sup> theyr speres y<sup>t</sup> they bothe
brake &#8266; shyuered in peces, &#8266; theye drewe theyr swerdes &#8266;
faught longe togyder, tylle at y<sup>e</sup> laste Alexander w<sup>t</sup> grete
myght and strengthe at one stroke smote of Guydoes hede, and
sent it vnto y<sup>e</sup> Emperour's doughter wherof she was ryght
gladde, &#8266; bare it vnto her fader &#8266; sayd, Fader beholde the hede
of hym y<sup>t</sup> you &#8266; me hath falsely defamed. whan y<sup>t</sup> the Emperoure
perceyued y<sup>e</sup> vyctory, anone he sent for Alexander whom
y<sup>t</sup> he beleued hadde ben Lodwyke &#8266; sayd, O Lodwyke this
daye youre honoure &#8266; my doughters ye haue saued. ye shall
stande &#8266; be the more in my grace &#8266; fauour, &#8266; what soeuer

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>

he be that hereafter more defame you he shall for euer stande
in my indygnacyon. Alexander answerd, god helpethe &#8266;
saueth theym y<sup>t</sup> trusteth in hym, &#8266; alwayes wreketh y<sup>e</sup> blode
vndeffectyue or innocent. But now my moost redoubted lorde
of one thynge I requyre you, at my departynge fro my fader I
lefte hym sore seke y<sup>t</sup> it wyll lyke you for to lycence me to go
&#8266; se how it standethe w<sup>t</sup> hym, &#8266; yf y<sup>t</sup> it be ony thynge
amended I shall incontynent come ayen. Then the Emperour
sayd, that pleaseth me well, but ye maye in no manere wyse
leue me for fro hensforth I can not be without your presence.
Alexander toke leue of y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure and bad hym fare well,
&#8266; rode ayen vnto his realme whome whan Lodwyke sawe he
made greate chere &#8266; gladnesse, &#8266; ryghte frendlye receyued hym
&#8266; sayd, O moste true frende of all frendes, tell me howe ye
haue done &#8266; spedd in your iourney &#8266; nede, and what ende ye
haue brought it to. Then sayd he, goo to y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure and
serue hym as ye haue done tofore. I haue goten you more
grace and fauoure of hym than euer ye haue hadde afore tyme
&#8266; I haue also smyten of the hede of youre enmye and aduersarye.
Then sayd Lodwyke, ye haue not only at this tyme saued my
lyfe, but many a tymes here afore, y<sup>e</sup> whiche as yet I can not
deserue, but god rewarde you, &#8266; so departed &#8266; wente ayen
vnto the Emperoure, &#8266; there was no man that knewe of the
absence of Alexander saue oonly Lodwyke. And whan as the
nyght was come he wente to bedde with the quene, &#8266; anone he
hadde with hyr swete &#8266; frendly wordes &#8266; her embraced &#8266; kyst.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>

Tho sayd she, ye haue made this tyme all to longe, that ye
haue not shewed ony thyng of frendshyp or loue, how may this
be. Thenne sayd he, wherfore saye ye that. She sayd, euery
nyght as I was in my bed ye haue layde betwyxe you &#8266; me a
naked swerde and ye haue neuer tasted or torned you towardes
me more than nowe. And whan the kynge herde y<sup>t</sup> he thought
on y<sup>e</sup> trouthe of hys felowe &#8266; sayd vnto hyr, O my moost dere
lady &#8266; quene, it was not do[ne] for none euyll wyll, but for a
gode probac&#333;n &#8266; for a perpetuall loue. But she thought in her
selfe y<sup>t</sup> loue shall ye neuer more haue of me, but y<sup>t</sup> dyspyte she
thought I shall auenge vpon the. Tho was there a knyght y<sup>t</sup>
she afore had a lytell loue and fauour vnto, &#8266; she began for to
loue hym more &#8266; more, so longe tyll at y<sup>e</sup> laste they thoughte
&#8266; ymagyned how they myght destroye &#8266; sle y<sup>e</sup> kyng, &#8266; therfor
they gate poyson &#8266; poysoned y<sup>e</sup> kynge, soo y<sup>t</sup> yf he had not ben
ryght stronge of complexyon he had deyed thereof but it
wrought in hym so sore y<sup>t</sup> it caused hym to be y<sup>e</sup> moost foule
and horryble lepre or laser y<sup>t</sup> euer was sene vpon erthe. The
lordes &#8266; noble men of his realme &#8266; the quene also seynge this
despysed hym &#8266; sayd, y<sup>t</sup> it behoued not a lepre to regne vpon
vs, for he sholde not procure nor engendre ony fayre or clene
heyres. And so he was deposed of y<sup>e</sup> dygnyte royall, &#8266; dryuen
out of his realme. &#182; In the meane tyme deyed the Emperour
of Rome, &#8266; Lodwyke wedded y<sup>e</sup> doughter &#8266; after that Lodwyke's
fader deyed, so that Lodwyke reygned bothe Emperoure &#8266;
kynge of Fraunce at ones. Whan kynge Alexander herde

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>

that he thought in hymselfe, nowe my felowe reygneth togyder
vpo<i>n</i> thempyre &#8266; the realme of Frau<i>n</i>ce, to whome maye I better
goo than to hym for whome many tymes I haue aduentured my
lyfe. and vpon a nyght he rose vp &#8266; made hym redy &#8266; toke
w<sup>t</sup> hym hys staff &#8266; claper, &#8266; yede towarde themperours courte.
And whan he was come nyghe to y<sup>e</sup> yate, he set hym amonges
other lasers abydynge y<sup>e</sup> gyuynge of y<sup>e</sup> almesse. and on a
season as y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure went out of his palays, all y<sup>e</sup> pore lasers
began to rynge theyr clapers, &#8266; y<sup>e</sup> gode kynge Alexander dyd
lyke y<sup>e</sup> other, but there was none almesse gyuen to them. He
taryed so longe vnto y<sup>e</sup> tyme y<sup>t</sup> themperour was set &#8266; serued
at y<sup>e</sup> table. Tho went kynge Alexander vnto y<sup>e</sup> yate &#8266;
knocked therat, &#8266; the porter asked who was there. Alexander
answerd hy<i>m</i> I am a pore despysed man, but for y<sup>e</sup> loue of god
I require you y<sup>t</sup> ye torne not your syght fro my vysage, and y<sup>t</sup>
ye wyll for y<sup>e</sup> rewarde of god do my message vnto y<sup>e</sup> Emperour.
he asked what is y<sup>e</sup> mater. Alexander sayd go &#8266; tell hym here
is a laser that ryght horryble is to see. The whiche prayeth
hym for the loue of god &#8266; kynge Alexander that he wyll grau<i>n</i>te
hy<i>m</i> this daye to ete his almesse afore hym vpon the erthe in his
hall. The porter sayd I wonder that ye dare desyre that of
my lorde, for why all the hall is full of lordes &#8266; noble me<i>n</i>, &#8266; yf
they beholde you they sholde all abhorre &#8266; leue theyr mete.
But for so moche as ye haue requyred me so profou<i>n</i>dly for y<sup>e</sup>
loue of god I shall go &#8266; do youre erande what so euer happen
therof. &#8266; so he yede forthe afore themperour &#8266; dyd his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>

message. Whan y<sup>e</sup> Emperour herde y<sup>e</sup> porter name Alexander
y<sup>e</sup> kynge of Egypte, he sayd to y<sup>e</sup> porter, go bryng hym
in afore me how horryble y<sup>t</sup> so euer his vysage be, &#8266; ordeyne
hym a place afore me, y<sup>t</sup> he may ete his mete afore me in my
presence. The porter brought hym in anone, &#8266; ordeyned hym
a place &#8266; set hym to mete afore y<sup>e</sup> Emperour, &#8266; whan he was
well refresshed he sayd vnto one of the Emperours seruau<i>n</i>tes,
My dere frende do me thys erande to y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure. Saye
vnto hym y<sup>t</sup> I praye hym for y<sup>e</sup> loue of god &#8266; kynge Alexander
y<sup>t</sup> he wylle sende me his cuppe w<sup>t</sup> wyne. The seruau<i>n</i>t sayd for
y<sup>e</sup> loue of god I shall doo it, but I beleue it wyll not be, for yf
ye ones drynke of my lordes cuppe, he wyll no more drynke of
y<sup>e</sup> same. neuerthelesse he dyd y<sup>e</sup> erande. Anone as the
Emperoure herde hym name kynge Alexander, he c&#333;maunded
his cuppe to be fylled of the beste wyne &#8266; bere it vnto hym.
The whiche wyne wha<i>n</i> he hadde receyued it he put it into hys
botelle, &#8266; toke his rynge y<sup>t</sup> Lodwyke had gyuen vnto hym &#8266;
put it in to the cuppe, &#8266; sent it ayen vnto y<sup>e</sup> Emperour, and
whan y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure sawe the rynge anone he knew it y<sup>t</sup> it was
the same y<sup>t</sup> he had gyuen vnto Alexander in frendeshyp whan
y<sup>t</sup> he departed fro hym, &#8266; thoughte in his herte y<sup>t</sup> Alexander is
dede, or ellys this man is merueylously come vnto y<sup>e</sup> rynge, &#8266;
c&#333;mau<i>n</i>ded anone that the laser sholde not departe vnto y<sup>e</sup> tyme
he had spoken w<sup>t</sup> hym, for in no wyse he coude haue knowlege
of hym nor yet reputed hym for Alexander, after that the dyner
was done &#8266;
ended, the Emperoure toke the seke man aparte

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>

and askyd howe he came by y<sup>e</sup> rynge. Alexander demau<i>n</i>ded
yf he knewe well y<sup>e</sup> rynge. The Emperour sayd, I knowe it
ryght well. Alexander sayd, wote ye also to whome ye haue
gyuen it. Themperour sayd I wote ryght well. Howe is it
than sayd Alexander y<sup>t</sup> ye knowe not me, for I am Alexander
to whome ye haue gyuen y<sup>e</sup> same rynge. whan the Emperoure
herde y<sup>t</sup> he felle downe to the grou<i>n</i>de for sorowe &#8266; tare and rente
his robys &#8266; clothes, &#8266; w<sup>t</sup> grete syghynges and bewaylynges sayd,
O Alexander ye be the one halfe of my soule, whehe (<i>sic</i>) is
your goodlye and delycate body y<sup>t</sup> was so fayre y<sup>t</sup> nowe so
vnclene &#8266; wretchedly is enfecte. he answered, This is me hapned
for the grete fydelyte that ye haue done to me in my bedde with
my wyfe, whan ye layd a naked swerde betwyxt you &#8266; hyr, wherfore
she became wrothe &#8266; hated me, that she &#8266; a knyght that
afore tyme she ought hir loue vnto haue impoysened me as ye
maye see. &#8266; aboue y<sup>t</sup> they haue dryuen me out of my realme.
&#8266; whan the Emperoure herde that he for loue toke hym aboute
y<sup>e</sup> necke &#8266; kyste hym &#8266; sayd, O my moost entyerlye beloued
brother, I sorowe to see you in this grete syknesse &#8266; mysery,
wolde god I myght deye for you, but my moost dere frende,
suffre pacyently a lytell tyme tyll y<sup>t</sup> we haue sente for all y<sup>e</sup>
physycyens &#8266; wyse maysters in physyke to haue theyr counseylle
&#8266; aduyse. yf there be ony remedye or hope of recouerynge
of your helthe, &#8266; yf it be possyble for to helpe you,
we shall neyther spare Empyre lordshyps nor other good temporall
to make you hole &#8266; sou<i>n</i>de. In the meane whyle he was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>

brought into a fayre chamber rychely appareylled &#8266; appoynted
of all maner thynges y<sup>t</sup> were requysyte &#8266; necessarye for his
ease &#8266; helthe. &#8266; in all haste he sente his messangers by all
partyes of y<sup>e</sup> worlde, for y<sup>e</sup> experte &#8266; moost wyse physycyens
y<sup>t</sup> myght be fou<i>n</i>de. Of whome within a moneth were come &#8266;
assembled before y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure xxx. y<sup>e</sup> whiche were ryght
experte &#8266; subtyll in y<sup>e</sup> scyence. To whome themperour sayd,
My welbeloued maysters I haue a frende y<sup>t</sup> greuousely is infecte
w<sup>t</sup> a lepry, whome I wolde ryght fayne were heled &#8266;
made sou<i>n</i>de. &#8266; no thynge theron to spare neyther golde ne
syluer ne all y<sup>e</sup> other goodes y<sup>t</sup> I haue in this worlde, but I
wolde gyue it to recouer hys helthe. The maysters answered
&#8266; sayd all y<sup>t</sup> euer is possyble to be done by physyke y<sup>t</sup> ye
shall sone vnderstande after y<sup>t</sup> we haue seen the persone. &#8266;
forthw<sup>t</sup> as they had seen hym, &#8266; perceyued y<sup>e</sup> cause &#8266; mater
of y<sup>e</sup> infyrmyte, they iuged it a dysease vncurable for all y<sup>e</sup>
maysters lyuynge. and whan the Emperoure herde y<sup>t</sup> he was
ryght sory in hys herte, &#8266; remytted it vnto y<sup>e</sup> helpe of almyghty
god callynge vnto hym relygyous men, &#8266; poore people,
&#8266; other deuoute persones &#8266; desyred theym to praye to god, y<sup>t</sup>
he wolde wouchesaufe to make hole his frende y<sup>e</sup> sooner for
theyr gode dedes &#8266; prayers. and he hymselfe with manye
other fasted &#8266; prayed humbly to almyghty god for y<sup>e</sup> helth of
his frende. Uppon a daye as kynge Alexander was in his
prayers, there came vnto hym a voyce saynge Yf the Emperoure
wyll w<sup>t</sup> his owne handes slee hys two sones, whiche his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>

wyfe hathe born by hym at one burden, &#8266; wasshe thy body w<sup>t</sup>
the blode of them, thy body &#8266; thy flesshe shall be as fayre &#8266;
as clene as y<sup>e</sup> flessh of the lytell chyldern. whan kynge Alexander
had herde this he thought in hymselfe, this vysyon is
not expedyente to be shewed for it is sore ayenste nature y<sup>t</sup>
ony man sholde slee his owne sones for y<sup>e</sup> recoueryng of the
helthe of a strau<i>n</i>ge man. The Emperour nyght &#8266; daye laye
in his prayers w<sup>t</sup> greate deuocyon, &#8266; prayed to god for y<sup>e</sup>
remedye of kynge Alexander. So y<sup>t</sup> at the laste there came a
voyce vnto hym &#8266; sayd, how longe shall ye thus crye &#8266; calle
vpon me whanne it is openly shewed &#8266; notefyed vnto Alexander
how that he shall be made hole. The Emperoure
herynge that wente vnto Alexander &#8266; sayd, Of all frendes y<sup>e</sup>
beste &#8266; mooste true, blessed be the moost hyghe god the
whyche neuer faylethe y<sup>t</sup> call &#8266; truste vpon hym, of whome I
haue knowlege y<sup>t</sup> it is shewed vnto you howe &#8266; in what
wyse that ye maye be made hole, wherfore I praye you that ye
wyll it openly shewe vnto me that we maye joye togyder. &#8266; yf
ye nede ony thynge therto that I maye do I shall fulfyll it vnto
my powere and for your helthe gyue all y<sup>t</sup> I haue. Alexander
said Syr I dare not shewe to you how y<sup>t</sup> I maye be cured or
heled of my maladye, for it excedethe &#8266; it is a thynge ayenste
nature for to be done, therfore I wyll not shewe it to you,
howe be it grete truste &#8266; confydence is in you. The Emperoure
sayde Alexander truste in me, for what so euer is possyble
for to be done for the recouerynge of youre helthe I shall

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>

do it &#8266; therfore hyde no thynge frome me. Then sayd Alexander
I haue of god knowlege y<sup>t</sup> yf ye wyll slee youre two
sones with youre owne handes &#8266; wasshe me in theyre blode I
sholde be hole, &#8266; therfore I haue not shewed it vnto you, for
me thynketh it is ayenst nature y<sup>t</sup> the fader sholde slewe his
owne chyldern for y<sup>e</sup> helthe of a straunge man. The Emperoure
sayd saye not y<sup>t</sup> ye be a straunge man, for I loue you
as I do my selfe, &#8266; therfore yf I hadde ten chyldern I sholde
notte spare one alyue to haue youre helthe. after that y<sup>e</sup>
Emperoure watched &#8266; spyed his tyme whan y<sup>e</sup> Empresse
&#8266; all ladyes &#8266; chambereres were oute of y<sup>e</sup> waye &#8266; whan
tyme was he entred into y<sup>e</sup> chamber where as the chyldern
slepte, &#8266; drewe out his knyfe &#8266; cutte asonder bothe theyr
throtes, &#8266; gadred y<sup>e</sup> blode in a vessell, &#8266; therin he bathed
&#8266; wasshed Alexander. &#8266; whan he was so bathed his body &#8266;
flesshe was as fayre &#8266; as clene as thought (<i>sic</i>) it had ben of
a yonge chylde. Then y<sup>e</sup> emperour had knowlege of his
vysage, &#8266; kyssed hym say<i>n</i>g, O good Alexander nowe I see
you in y<sup>e</sup> same forme whiche I haue often tymes dylected in,
blessed be god that euer I hadde thyse chyldern, by ye whome
ye be holpen and made hole. &#8266; yet wyste no man of the deth
of y<sup>e</sup> chyldern saue oonly y<sup>e</sup> emperoure &#8266; Alexander. &#8266; whan
as the emperoure sawe y<sup>t</sup> Alexander was parfytly heled, he sayd
vnto hym, I shall ordeyne to you an honeste companye &#8266; ye
shall go frome hens ten myle the next daye sende vnto me a
messager, &#8266; y<sup>t</sup> ye shew openly vnto me of youre comynge, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>

I shall then with all solempnyte come &#8266; mete you, &#8266; ye shall
abyde with me vnto the tyme that we maye otherwyse prouyde
for y<sup>e</sup> recouerynge of youre realme. This cou<i>n</i>seyll pleased
Alexander ryght well, &#8266; accordynge to y<sup>e</sup> same it was done,
for on y<sup>e</sup> nexte daye came y<sup>e</sup> messager vnto the emperoure
shewynge hym y<sup>e</sup> comynge of kynge Alexander &#8266; whanne the
empresse herde that she was ryghte gladde, &#8266; sayd vnto the
emperoure, O my lorde haue ye not nowe a cause of greate
ioye, that kyng Alexander whome we of a longe tyme haue not
seen. and yf it please you to go and mete hym with your lordes
and seruau<i>n</i>tes, I shall folowe you with my ladyes &#8266; gentylwymen.

rode they forth with a grete companye and met with the kynge
Alexander and whan they mette togyder, with greate reuerence

hede to my wordes y<sup>t</sup> I shall saye to you. Sawe ye not y<sup>e</sup> foule

me for the loue of god &#8266; kynge Alexander y<sup>t</sup> I shold gyue

man I neuer behelde. then sayd Themperoure, I demaunde
nowe this of you. I put case y<sup>t</sup> he were kynge Alexander &#8266;
that he in ony wyse coude not be made hole but w<sup>t</sup> the

wherfore demau<i>n</i>de ye me y<sup>t</sup> question. I saye &#8266; lete you haue

slee them w<sup>t</sup> min owne handes to prepare &#8266; ordeyne for hym

sende vs mo chyldern. but suche a true frende were as a thynge

O wyfe had ye leuer haue your chyldern dede than Alexander
shold be in y<sup>t</sup> sekenesse of lepery. therfore shall I open and

The nourysshes of y<sup>e</sup> chyldern vnderstandynge this, w<sup>t</sup> grete

But he wold not suffre theym for to doo too hym suche

one of his seruauntes the whiche serued hym therof. Thenne
sayd the knyght, ye wyll not suffre vs too do it for our honour,
for we are not worthy therto. The kynge sayd, haue not I

Tho asked the knyghte, My lorde wherfore enquyre ye thus

pardone me my lyfe &#8266; I shall shew you y<sup>e</sup> very trouthe. The

he, Souerayne lorde we had a sone oonly y<sup>t</sup> was wyse &#8266; lettred

Tho sayd the kynge what euyll myght haue come to you yf
he hadd ben made so grete &#8266; myghty, me thynketh it sholde
haue been youre honoure &#8266; proufyte. The knyghte sayd lorde
it was no reason but a woodnesse. The kynge answered: y<sup>t</sup>

<h2 class="nobreak">[How Judgement was given upon the Empress and how that<br />
she and her Lover were both put to death.</h2>
</div>

<p>[Then the Emperor commanded the judges and justices to sit
in judgement and to bring again the Empress before them;
with the Ladies and also the Ribauld, her best beloved, cloathed
in the vesture and habit of a woman, whom he did cause to
stand next unto the Empress; then the Emperor's son asked
sentence and just judgement upon them, saying,</p>

<p>[My most honourable Lord and father, even as you are Emperour
of the World; and that your majesty and power requireth
to do true justice unto all your subjects that desire it:
so now I demand that you this day do give right sentence and
true judgement upon the untruth, falshood and shame which
were put and alledged unto me by the Empress; for the which
accusations I have been seven times led unto the gallows and
have stood in great jeopardy and peril of my life; and also that
she hath been to you untrue of her body as you have seen by
good proof made before you; and on the which I ask judgement;
and therefore command your Justices and Judges to
give sentence thereupon, according to Right, Equity and Law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>[As soon as the Empress heard this, she fell flat to the earth
before the Emperor and asked mercy and forgiveness for her
just offence and misdoing; but it helped nor profited nothing,
for the son would have right and desired Judgement. Then
spake the Judges and Justices, her own misdeeds condemn her,
and the report of her Lemmon by her kept and found; therefore
we give sentence against the Empress, that she shall be
bound to a horses tail and drawn through all the streets of the
city to the place] of execucyon &#8266; there to be brent. &#8266; we
iuge also &#8266; gyue sentence ayenste the rybaude y<sup>t</sup> he shall be
quartred &#8266; smyten in peces &#8266; his flesshe caste vnto ye houndes,
and byrdes of y<sup>e</sup> ayre for to deuoure hym, &#8266; this se<i>n</i>tence was
approbate &#8266; alowed of all people. &#182; Hereafter in shorte tyme
deyed y<sup>e</sup> Emperoure, &#8266; Dyoclesyan his sone gouerned &#8266; ruled
thempyre w<sup>t</sup> grete wysdome, &#8266; helde &#8266; kept his maysters w<sup>t</sup>
hym in grete honoure &#8266; glorye. By whoos cou<i>n</i>seyll &#8266; wysdom
he gouerned the Empyre, y<sup>t</sup> he excelled all his predecessours in
rychesse &#8266; in doynge iustice &#8266; ryght. And his maysters loued
hym aboue all other thynges in the worlde. So that many
tymes they put themselfe in grete perylle &#8266; ieoperdye of ther
lyues for hym. And so they ended theyr dayes in grete joye
&#8266; honoure, and c&#333;mended theym to almyghty god.</p>

Introduction.


The history of the _Seven Wise Masters_ forms an important epoch in
the history of European popular stories, because it affords the most
remarkable evidence of the literary descent and origin of stories,
as distinct from a traditional descent. Professor Comparetti in
his _Researches respecting the Book of Sindibad_, published by the
Folk-Lore Society, Mr. Clouston in his _Bakhtyar Nama_ and in his
_Book of Sindibad_, two privately printed books, and Mr. Wright in his
_Sevyn Sages_, printed by the Percy Society in 1846, have practically
exhausted the literary history of this famous collection of stories.
Shortly summarised from these three sources the main facts are these.
There was an ancient original Indian book of stories which became so
popular that it was copied frequently, and thus handed down from one
generation to another. From this book two separate groups of texts
have descended. To the first belong all the texts in the Eastern
languages; to the other belong the _Dolopathos_, the _Historia Septem
Sapientum_, the _Erasto_, and other numerous texts of the various
European literatures of the Middle Ages. With the Eastern group
of texts we have now nothing to do beyond saying that Professor
Comparetti has restored, in the scholarly book above mentioned, the
form of the original text for the guidance of the modern student. The
Western group of texts has a history of its own quite apart from its
Eastern origin. It has kept the original framework, but it has varied
the setting; and this variation will be found of great interest to the
student of popular tradition. Before, however, we come to this part of
the subject, let us see the kind of work with which we are dealing. The
framework of the romance is as follows: A young prince, falsely accused
by the wife of the king, his father, of having attempted to offer her
violence, is defended by seven sages, who relate a series of stories
to show the deceits of women, the queen at the same time urging the
death of the accused prince by the example of stories told by herself.
This system of story-telling is practically the same as that adopted in
the _Arabian Nights_. Boccaccio adopted this plan in his _Decameron_;
Chaucer adopted it in his _Canterbury Tales_.

Among the Eastern texts is a famous one in Hebrew, dating as far
back as the first half of the thirteenth century. Under the title of
_Historia Septem Sapientum Romæ_, a Latin translation of this was made
by Dam Jehans, a monk of the abbey of Haute Selve, in the diocese of
Nancy, in the thirteenth century. The earliest printed copy of this
version that I have been able to find is one printed at Cologne in
1490, of which I shall say something a little further on.

It was through this Latin version that the work was communicated to
nearly all the languages of Western Europe; and in 1520 a translation
into English was printed by the famous printer Wynkyn de Worde. A fine
copy of this is preserved in the British Museum, and from it is printed
the text of the present version. One or two pages are missing from this
copy, and the passages are restored from the earliest chap-book version
which I have been able to discover—namely, that printed in 1671 at
London, and belonging to the British Museum. This chap-book version is
nearly identical with the Wynkyn de Worde, with the simple alteration
of the spelling to the modern forms. One curious variation, however,
illustrating the force of the change of religious opinions at the time
of the Reformation, is well worth noting. On page 173 of our text will
be found related how the murdered children of the Emperor Lodwyke were
found alive singing "of ye moost blessed vyrgyne Mary, aue Maria gracia
plena dn̄s tecum," but in the chap-book of 1671 it is said they were
singing praises to the Almighty.

Since 1671 many chap-book versions have been issued, and I have
succeeded in obtaining a copy still published in Dublin. These later
versions are all much deteriorated from the original. Besides the 1671
edition, there are the following: London 1684, 1687, and 1697; Glasgow
1713; London [1750]; Newcastle 1750; London 1780—7 [1785]; Boston 1794;
London 1805; Warrington 1815. And I have no doubt that it has been
continually reproduced until the present day.

Besides the closeness of the translation of the prose version of
Wynkyn de Worde, one curious feature to be noted is the series of
illustrations. It is well known that German woodcuts supplied English
books with illustrations,[1] and this is a good instance of the
practice. In the _Bibliographer_ (vol. ii. p. 70) Mr. W. M. Conway has
told the history of the woodcuts of the Lubeck edition of the _Seven
Wise Men_. It was first printed in April, 1488, with the name of Claes
Leeu, probably a brother of Gerard Leeu. In 1490 appeared another
edition printed at Cologne by J. Koelhof de Lubeck, to whom the blocks
must have been lent. He returned them to Leeu with the exception of
one, which was either retained by him or lost on the journey; and the
imperfect set, a new block being made by some other hand to replace
the lost one, was employed in the edition printed by Leeu on the 6th
November, 1490. One of the cuts (see p. 21) represents the Emperor
coming angrily into the chamber of his wife with a drawn sword in his
hand and reproaching her with her infidelity. She is seated on a chair
on the right, with her hands clasped in an attitude rather of shyness
than fear or remorse. One reason for this seems to be discoverable from
the fact that along the top of the bed behind, the words _Ave regina
coelorum_ can be traced carved in reverse; and it is quite possible
that the whole cut, with the exception of the figure of the Emperor,
was copied from some print representing the Annunciation.

Both these editions, that by J. Koelhof de Lubeck and that printed by
Gerard Leeu on 6th November, 1490, are in the library of the British
Museum, the latter under the title of _Historia de Calumnia Novercali_.
This book has a preface not contained in the other edition, and it
formed the subject of a communication to the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for
1767, p. 541, in a letter signed T. From this letter it would appear
that later editions were issued. The preface quoted in the letter is
the same as the preface in the British Museum copy, but the words of
the latter are much more contracted than the writer in the _Gentleman's
Magazine_ indicates was the case with his copy. This letter is, I
think, worth reproducing, as it conveys some useful information. It is
as follows:—

"I lately met with a mutilated copy of a book, which to me, at
least, appears a curiosity. It bears for its title, _Historia de
Calumnia Novercali_: an history now commonly sold at stalls for the
entertainment of English children, under the title of _The History of
the Seven Wise Masters_; with which last-mentioned book mine agrees as
to the substance and order of the tales, but differs considerably from
it in the form and manner of relating them.

"It is printed in sixteens, in the common Gothic character of the time
(the beginning, as I judge, of the 16th century), an _English_ or
_black_ face approaching to a _Roman_, on a _pica_ body, and with many
abbreviations, and is ornamented with wooden cuts of the size of the
pages, which, considering their age, are by no means contemptible.

"The preface runs thus:—

"'Compositâ pridem _Calumniæ Novercalis Historia_ quæ _Septem
Sapientum_ dicitur, pulchro quidem argumento, pulchris etiam ac
memoratu dignis tractata exemplis, in utramq: partem & defensionis &
condemnationis sive vera sive ficta sit, nihil ad te attinere puto
mi _Gerarde_: magis autem quid doceat adverte, intelligimus ex ea &
qui sint malarum mulierum, & pravorum liberorum, & zelotyporum itemq:
delirorum senum aliarumq: personarum mores atq: fortunæ variâ ratione,
ut quid caveri quidve eligi oporteat agnoscamus. Cum autam nominum
quorundam ratio temporibus satis respondere visa non esset, & textus
nimium fluxus minimeq: cohærens videretur non indignum judicavi quo
tibi morem gererem id postulanti, paululum mutatis verbis obmissisq:
nominibus ne legentem offendant, re ipsa integra servata, hanc
narationem efferre; ne quid inventori laudis aut inventioni veritatis
detractum esse videatur: imposito potius nomine _Calumniæ Novercalis_
qualis & Phædræ fuit is Hyppolitum; et simili quoq: genere uxoris
Putipharis in Joseph Hebræum; & senum illorum in Susannam; ut eo nomine
historia hæc majorem notitiam gratiamq: apud lectores sit habitura.'

"From hence it appears that this book is an alteration and improvement
of a more ancient work, intitled _Historia Septem_ _Sapientum_, and,
as the particulars here said to be altered are retained unaltered in
the English translation, it should seem that the English history is
translated from a performance of a more early date than this."

The woodcuts of the Wynkyn de Worde are not identical with the Cologne
edition, but copies, having been decidedly improved. All these are
reproduced in facsimile in the present edition. Owing to the missing
pages, one or two of these illustrations are not given in the British
Museum copy. The Cologne edition contains a frontispiece plate, one
after the first two as printed on pages 4 and 8 of our text, and two
printed at the end of the book, making four in all, which are not
contained in the British Museum copy of the Wynkyn de Worde.

We will now consider the stories given in this version of the _Seven
Wise Masters_. Although the framework, as I have pointed out, is
ancient, the setting has been altered. The stories that suited Eastern
fancy did not suit Western; and accordingly we have a considerable
variation. In order to have the stories clearly before us, the
following analysis will be found useful:—

(1.) _The first example of the Empress._—In the garden of a Roman
burgess was a tree famed for its cure of all diseases—the burgess one
day discovered a "fair young imp"—this was planted and put under the
care of the gardener—the young tree did not flourish—the burgess
commanded the branches of the overshading old tree to be cut down
to the ground—the young tree then did not flourish—the burgess
commanded the old tree to be cut down to the ground—the young tree
died.

(2.) _The example of the first Master._—A knight had one son—also
a greyhound and a falcon—the knight went to a tourney—a serpent
in the hall attacked the child—the falcon roused the attention of
the greyhound—the greyhound fought the serpent and killed it—the
greyhound, wounded, went and laid down by the cradle of the child,
which became covered with his blood—the nurses coming in thought the
child was killed by the greyhound—they tell their mistress, who tells
the knight—the knight kills the greyhound—he afterwards discovers his
error and repents.

(3.) _The second example of the Empress._—An Emperor had a forest in
which was a boar that destroyed all men going through the forest—the
Emperor proclaimed that whoever should slay the boar should marry
his daughter—a shepherd by stratagem slew the boar, and married the
daughter.

(4.) _The example of the second Master._—In a city there was an
ancient knight who had married a young wife—there was a law or custom
in that city that whoever was found in the streets after the ringing of
a certain bell should be put in the pillory—the wife had a paramour,
and every night she went to her lover. One night the husband woke and
missed his wife, and on her return would not let her in—she went to
the well and pretended to drown herself—the husband came out of the
house to help his wife out of the well—she then ran into the house
and locked the doors, and her husband being found in the streets by
the watch, was taken to prison and on the morrow put in the pillory.

(5.) _The third complaint of the Empress._—There was in Rome a
knight that had two daughters and one son—the knight, by hunting and
tournaments, spent all his substance. There was an emperor at that time
who had a tower full of gold—the knight and his son agreed to steal
some of the gold—the keeper of the tower put a vessel full of pitch
that the robber might fall in—the second time the knight and his son
went the knight fell into the pitch—the son cut off the father's head
and hid it, that the body should not be recognized—the daughters of
the knight made a great outcry on seeing their father's body dragged
through the streets—the son then wounded himself, and the officers
believed his story that it was on account of his wound that his sisters
made lamentations.

(6.) _The example of the third Master._—There was a rich burgess that
had a "pie" which he loved and taught to speak—his wife had a lover
who visited her in the absence of the burgess—the pie threatened to
tell the burgess—the wife imitated rain and hail and snow on the
bird's cage and nearly killed her—when the burgess returned the pie
told him that his wife's lover had stayed all night with her, and that
the hail, rain, and snow that night had nearly killed him—the master
hearing that the night had been quite fine, killed the bird, thinking
it had told lies—he afterwards found out the truth.

(7.) _The fourth example of the Empress._—There were once seven wise
masters who governed Rome under an Emperor, who by their artifices
they made blind whenever he left the palace—the Emperor, on pain of
death, desired the seven wise masters to cure him—the masters discover
a child who shewed the meaning of dreams—they brought him to the
Emperor—the child discovered in the Emperor's bedchamber a well which
had seven springs—the child commanded the wise masters to be killed,
one at a time, and thrown into the well—the well and springs vanished.

(8.) _The example of the fourth Master._—There was an old knight who
married a young wife—the wife wished to have a lover, but on the
persuasion of her mother tried the knight three times: 1st, by cutting
down a favourite tree—2nd, by killing a favourite hound—3rd, by
destroying everything on the table at a banquet. The two first the
knight forgave, the third time he brought a barber who opened veins in
the wife's arms—the wife thereupon said she would be content with her
husband.

(9.) _The fifth example of the Empress._—There reigned in Rome an
Emperor who was covetous and loved gold above all things.—In the city
was a wise master who made a tower, and in it as many images as there
were provinces governed by Rome, and when there was any rebellion or
dispute in these distant provinces the images rang a bell, and so
informed the people. The kings of these provinces consulted together
how best to defeat Rome. Four knights undertook to get the images
and tower destroyed if they could have four tons of gold—they took
this and went to Rome—and represented themselves as soothsayers, and
pretended to discover by dreams quantities of gold which they had
previously hidden—they obtained permission of the Emperor to dig
under the tower for more gold—undermined the tower and rode away—the
counsellors of the Emperor put him to death for betraying the image to
their enemies.

(10.) _The example of the fifth Master._—There was a famous physician
named Ypocras—he had a nephew named Galienus, who in time excelled
Ypocras—the king of Ungary sent for Ypocras to cure his son—Ypocras
sent Galienus instead—Galienus on seeing the sick child said to
the queen that the king was not its father, and demanded to know
who was—the queen told him the truth and Galienus cured the child.
Ypocras on hearing from Galienus that he had cured the child killed
him by craft—Ypocras was taken grievously sick, and his scholars
and disciples were unable to heal him—He knew that for the death of
Galienus he was made sick—confessed from envy he had slain him, and
died.

(11.) _The sixth example of the Empress._—There was a king
marvellously deformed in his visage so that women hated and abhorred
him—the king desired his steward to bring a fair and beauteous
woman, and promised a large sum of money to the woman—the steward
from covetousness insisted on his own wife going to the king and thus
obtaining the money—the king found out that the steward had undone
his own wife, banished him on pain of death and kept the wife. The king
assembled a great army to conquer Rome, but by the stratagems of seven
wise masters there was defeated with great slaughter and killed.

(12.) _The example of the sixth Master._—There was an emperor of Rome
who had three knights whom he loved above all others. There was also in
the city an ancient knight who had a fair young wife—this wife would
sit at her window looking into the street and sing. The three knights
at different times passed her window and fell in love with her—they
each offered her a hundred florins—she consented to receive them,
promising to send for them on a suitable opportunity. She told her
husband, and suggested that when the knights came he should kill them
and keep the hundred florins—the husband consented and killed each of
the knights—the wife got her brother to dispose of the first body, and
by telling him the corpse had come back again, of the other two—the
husband afterwards quarrelled with his wife and struck her—she in
revenge told how he had murdered the three knights—they were both
drawn at a horse's tail and hanged.

(13.) _The seventh example of the Empress._—A king loved his wife
above all things and locked her up alwayes in a strong castle and
kept the keys himself. A knight in distant parts dreamed of a fair
queen whose love he would win—the queen dreamt the same night of
the knight—the knight travelled about till he came to the queen's
tower, and knew her for the lady of his dream.—He entered the king's
service—fought bravely, was made the king's steward, and gained
permission of the king to build a place adjoining the castle—He built
a secret passage to the queen's rooms—gained her love—she gave him
a ring the king had given her—the king saw the ring on the knight's
hand and demanded of the queen the ring he had given her—she showed it
to the king having previously got it back from the knight—the knight
asked the king to be present at a banquet at which would be his lady
love—presented the queen to the king as a lady of his own country—the
king after the banquet went to the queen's rooms, found her there, and
thought he had been mistaken a second time—the knight asked the king
to be present at his wedding and to give the bride away—the king gave
the queen to the knight and saw them sail away from the city—went back
to the castle and found out how he had been deceived.

(14.) _The example of the seventh Master._—A knight had a fair young
wife whom he tenderly loved—one day she cut her hand and the sight of
her blood killed her husband—she bewailed his death greatly—would
not leave the grave—her friends made a little house close by where
she might stay and get food. When a trespasser against the law was
hanged the sheriff was obliged to watch all night by the gallows, and
if the body was stolen the sheriff had to lose his land and his life.
It happened soon after that a man was hanged, and the sheriff watched
by the gallows—he saw the little house, asked permission to enter
to warm himself—the sheriff went back to the gallows and found the
body stolen—told the lady, who advised him, if he would marry her, to
take up her dead husband and hang him on the gallows in place of the
thief—when the body was dug up, the sheriff said he could not hang
her husband up as he was, the thief having lost two front teeth, his
ears, and was otherwise mutilated—the lady mutilated her husband in a
corresponding manner—she reminded the sheriff of his promise to marry
her—he refused, and killed her.

(15.) _The example of Dioclesian, the King's son._—A knight had one
son, who was sent away to learn, and returned well favoured—as they
sat at table a nightingale sang—the son interpreted the song to mean
that he should become great and be waited upon by his father and
mother—the knight was angered, and cast his son into the sea—the son
swam to land, from which he was rescued by a ship—the shipmen sold
him to a duke—the duke took him into favour—the king of the country
(Egypt) summoned his council to tell him why ravens followed him
wherever he went, and promised to give his daughter to him who would
interpret the event—the child, who went with the duke, interpreted
the event, and the ravens left the country—the king thereupon took
the child, Alexander, to live with him—before marrying his daughter,
Alexander asked leave to visit the court of Titus—leave was granted,
and he went and was much loved—there came also the son of the King of
France, Lodwyke—the two, Lodwyke and Alexander, were much alike—the
emperor had a daughter whom Lodwyke fell in love with—Alexander used
to attend her—she fell in love with him—he, however, allowed Lodwyke
to attend her in his stead—he assisted Lodwyke in his suit—presented
gifts to her three times on behalf of Lodwyke—finally she consented
to receive Lodwyke—the knights found out the intrigue, and sought
to slay Lodwyke, but Alexander defended his friend—letters came to
tell Alexander of the death of the King of Egypt—Alexander went to
Egypt—Lodwyke at parting gave him a ring—Guydo, son of the King of
Spain, then came to the court—he found out Lodwyke with the emperor's
daughter, and told the emperor—a day of battle between Lodwyke and
Guydo was appointed—Lodwyke was afraid to meet him, and by advice of
the emperor's daughter got the day of battle adjourned, and went to
Alexander—Alexander was going to be married to his betrothed—being
so like Lodwyke he agreed to take his place, and Lodwyke was to take
Alexander's place at the wedding, and to put a naked sword between
him and Alexander's wife on the night of their marriage—Alexander
went, as Lodwyke, and defeated and slew Guydo—Lodwyke, as Alexander,
married his betrothed and kept the compact of putting a sword between
them—when Alexander returned his wife, annoyed at him not loving
her the first night, would not accept his embraces—she grew to love
a knight, and by poison made Alexander a leper—he was driven from
Egypt—he travelled to Lodwyke's court (who had succeeded Titus on the
throne)—he made himself known to Lodwyke—Lodwyke asked his master
to cure his friend—they could not do so—the only cure was revealed
to Alexander in a dream—it was for Lodwyke to kill his two sons and
wash his body with the blood of them—Lodwyke does this, and his wife
afterwards agrees to it—Alexander is restored—the sons come to life
again—Lodwyke assists Alexander in the recovery of Egypt—after a
time he resolved to see his father and mother—he goes to them without
revealing himself—they wait upon him—he then reveals himself to them,
forgave them, and took them, honoured, to Egypt.

       *       *       *       *       *

Of these fifteen stories only three are the same as those given in the
_Book of Sindibad_, as published by Professor Comparetti—namely, No.
2, the example of the first Master, which is told by the fifth Master
in the Sindibad version; No. 6, the example of the third Master, which
is told by the first Master of the Sindibad version; and No. 11, the
sixth example of the Empress, which is told by the fourth Master of the
Sindibad version. No. 3, the second example of the Empress, may perhaps
be a variant of the fifth example of the Empress in the Sindibad
version. The remaining stories then might, _prima facie_, be considered
of Western origin; and perhaps genuine Folk-Tales thus early enshrined
in literature. No. 4 is to be found in Peter Alfonsi's _Disciplina
Clericalis_ and in the Decameron. And Mr. Wright, in his Introduction
to The _Seuyn Sages_ (Percy Society), p. liii. says he heard the same
story told traditionally in an English country town of a townsman
who had a scolding unruly wife. No. 5 is a variant of the legend of
Rhampsinitus, king of Egypt, as told by Herodotus; and a similar
legend is given in Pausanias, lib. ix. c. 37. No. 7 contains some of
the incidents of Merlin's story told by the Chroniclers. No. 10, the
example of the fifth Master, is something like Campbell's "Fearachur
Leigh," No. xlvii. of his _Highland Stories_ (vol. ii. p. 161). No.
13 bears an analogy to the plot of the _Miles Gloriosus_ of Plautus.
Upon the entire question of the occurrence elsewhere of these stories I
would refer to Mr. Clouston's _Book of Sindibad_ privately printed in
1884.

There are one or two curious words and expressions which may be of use
to the philologist, but the reader will find that the language used
is mainly that of the present day with a different spelling. Some of
the difficulties of this style have been obviated by the insertion,
where necessary, of letters left out in contracted words, and these
insertions are printed in italics to distinguish them from the original.

it to the vttermoste of our powers. To whome yᵉ noble Emperour sayde,
I haue but one sone the which I shal delyuer vnto you to nourysshe and
to teche. so that by your doctryne [et] wysdome he maye the more wysly
guyde and gouerne yᵉ empyre after my decesse.

¶ The fyrste mayster named Pantyllas sayde, Lorde delyuer too me your
sone [et] I shall teche hym as moche connȳge wᵗin vii. yere as I and
all my felowes can. Then spake the seconde mayster that named was
Lentulus, Syr of longe tyme I haue serued you, [et] hytherto I haue had
no maner reward. I demaunde nothyng elles of you but that ye delyuer me
your sone to lerne and gouerne. and I shall make hym as connynge within
vi. yere as I [et] all my felowes be. The thyrde mayster sayd that
had to name Craton, My lorde many tymes haue I ben with you vpon the
se in peryll of my lyfe / [et] of you haue I had no maner of rewarde,
yf that I myghte for my rewarde obteyne that ye wolde wouchesauf to
commytte your sone vnder my rule [et] gouernaunce, I sholde enfourme
hym as moche within v. yere. yf his wit therto wyll attayne as I
and my felowes can. Tho stode vp the fourth mayster that to name
had Malquydrac ryght lene of body [et] sayd, My lorde calle to your
remembraunce how that I and al my predecessours haue serued emperours
[et] haue receyued no maner of rewarde. Wherfore I shal aske none other
thȳge but yᵗ ye wyll delyuer me your sone to enfourme [et] teche / [et]
I shall make hym to take asmoche scyence [et] wysdome within foure
yere as I and al my felowes haue lerned in all our lyues. Than spake
yᵉ fyfth mayster yᵗ was called Joseph, lorde I am old [et] many tyms
I am called to your coūseyl / [et] yᵗ my coūseyll ye knowe well hath
auayled [et] p_er_fyted you [et] yet I folowe yᵉ same. But I desyre no
more saue to delyuer me your sone [et] I shal enstructe [et] enfourme
hȳ in as moche conynge [et] scyence that he wᵗin iii yere shal profyte
[et] wyte as moche as I [et] alle my felowes. tho came forth the syxte
mayster that was named Cleophas whiche sayd lyke the other p_ro_mysynge
to lerne [et] enfourme yᵉ chylde in alle theyr connynges wᵗn two yere.
The seuenth muyster (_sic_) rose vp [et] sayd, which also desyred the
chylde [et] promysed for to lerne hym wᵗin one yere n̄ scyences and
wysdome of them all. As all this was done. Than the Emperour sayde
my trusty frendes I am moche bounden to thanke you all, and euery of
you, for that eueryche of you haue so effectuelly desyred my sone to
nouryssh [et] lerne. If I sholde now commytte hym to one and not to an
other / therof sholde come yᵉ descencyon [et] varyaunce amonges you.
Therfore to you al [et] euery of you I commyt my sone to nourysshe
and to teche. The maysters heryng this wᵗ. grete thankȳges gyuynge
to the Emperoure toke [et] receyued his sone, and ladde hym towardes
the courte of Rome. ¶ Upon the waye spake Craton to his felowes, If
we this chylde sholde lerne within the Cyte of Rome there is so grete
resorte [et] concourse of people that it sholde hynder [et] lette hym
in his lernynge [et] fantasyenge. I wote a fayre place withoute rome
thre myle ryght pleasaunte [et] delectable: there lete vs do make a.
iiii square cha_m_ber of stone [et] put hȳ therin [et] vpō yᵉ walles
of yᵉ syde lete vs paȳte [et] wryte yᵉ .vii. artes lyberales, so yᵗ yᵉ
chylde al times may se [et] beholde therin his doctrine as wel as in
his boke [et] th_i_s aduyse [et] counseyll pleased theym all. and was
done accordynge in euery poynte. The maysters dylygently euery daye
durynge .vii. yere taught [et] lettred the chylde. whiche maysters
determyned amonge themselfe and sayde / It is good yᵗ we examen our
dyscyple how he is spedde in connynge [et] scyence. They al accorded to
the same. Tho sayd mayster Pancyllas / howe shall we proue hym. Craton
sayde, Lete euery of vs as he slepeth put vnder euery corner of his bed
an olyue leue, and than we shall knowe yf he perceyued or felte ony
thynge or not, this done he wakynge gretely marueyllynge lyftynge vp
his eyen towarde yᵉ rofe of the chamber feruently. The maysters seynge
yᵗ sayd. Wherfore lyft ye vp your eyen so sharply. He answered it is
no merueyll, for in my slepe I saw the vppermost parte of the chamber
inclyned towarde the erthe, or vnder me it was lyfte vp. This hery_n_ge
yᵉ maysters sayd amonge themselfe, Yf this childe may lyue he shal be a
man of grete connȳge [et] fame.

How the Emperour by the coūseyll of yᵉ grete pry_n_ces [et] lordes of
his Empyre wedded an other wyfe.


The prynces and grete lordes of the Empyre in the meane tyme came to
the Emperour [et] sayd, My lorde ye haue only but one sone, it is
possyble yᵗ he myght happen to dye. And therfore it were profytable
that ye sholde wedde an other wyfe to engendre and make mo chyldren to
thentente that the Empyre of Rome be not lefte without heyre. Also ye
are so myghty that yf it sholde happen you to gete many chyldren ye
may promote [et] auaunce them all to grete dygnytees and lordshyppes.
Therupon answerde themperour, It is your counseyll that I shall take
an other wyfe, than seke me one yᵗ is gracyous / pure vyrgyne fayre
and gentyll borne, [et] than shall I folowe your counseyll and aduyse.
They went [et] sought and serched many kyngdomes and londes [et] at the
laste they founde the kynges doughter of Castyle that ryght fayre was
[et] beateuouse, [et] her they gaue the Emperour to wyf. She behad her
so well that anone in her loue he was taken so sore that he forgate and
put in oblyuyon all the heuynesse [et] sorowe of his herte that he had
taken for yᵉ deth of his fyrste wyfe. And they lyued longe togyder
wᵗout chyldren. And as Thempresse sawe yᵗ she myght not cõceyue for she
herde yᵗ themperour had a sone wᵗ seuen wyse maysters to lerne [et]
nourysshe to yᵉ behouffe [and] p[ro]fyte of Thempyre, she thought in
herself [et] wysshed his deth. And from yᵗ houre forth she ymagyned how
she myght conspyre his deth. It hapned on a nyght as yᵉ Emperour lay in
his bed, he sayd to thempresse, My [most dear and best beloved wife, I
shall now open to you the secrets of my heart, for under the sun there
is no creature that I love so well as you and therefore trust in my
love.

[Then said the fair Empress: if it be so as you say, I require of you,
a little boon or petition. Desire what you will, said the Emperor and
all that to me is possible, I shall fulfil, and give it to you. Then
said the Empress, my dear Lord, you know I have no child yet by you
conceived for which I am sore pensive and heave; but Fame that never
conceals it self long to true joy, hath delivered this happy truth
to me; that ye have one Son only the which is sent to the seven Wise
Masters to be taught and governed, and him I hold and require for my
own son: wherefore I beseech ye send for him that I may see him and
have consolation of his presence, as though he were mine own. Hereupon
answered the Emperor it is sixteen years past since I saw him, your
will shall be fulfilled. Incontinent the Emperor sent unto the seven
wise Masters a Letter sealed with his secret Sign, that upon pain of
death they should bring his son in the feast of Penticost following.

[Illustration]




    [How the seven Wise Masters after the sight of the
    Emperor's letter would first observe the course and
    divine for shewing of the Firmament, and Planets,
    whether it were good to obey his commandment or not.


[And when the Masters by the letter had understood the Emperors will
in the night they went and beheld the stars in the Firmament, whether
it would be expedient to bring the child to the Emperor or not? and
they saw clearly in the stars, that if they should lead the child in
that time assigned, at the first word he should speak he should die
an evil death: wherefore they were all very sorry; and as they beheld
another star, they saw, that if they delivered not the child at the day
aforesaid, they should lose their heads. Then said one of them of two
evils the least is to be chosen: it is better that all we die, than
that the child should lose his life: therefore that we may save the
childs life let us go to the Emperor. And as they were thus sorrowful,
the child came down from his chamber, and seeing his Masters so heavy,
he demanded the cause of their heaviness: whereunto they answered: Sir,
we have received your Fathers Letters that upon pain of death, now this
high feast of Penticost we shall lead you to your countrey, whereupon
we have beholden the firmament, wherein we clearly find, that if we
(within the time prefixed) present you to your father, at the first
word that ye shall pronounce out of your mouth ye shall be to the most
vilest death condemned. Then said the child, I must also behold the
Firmament with the stars: and so he did; and found clear in a little
star, that if he could abstain from speaking seven dayes, he should
be preserved and save his life. And after he had seen this, he call'd
his Masters and shewed them the star, and said Behold my dear Masters,
I see perfectly in the star, that if I abstain myself seven daies, I
shall save my life. Ye are now seven Masters, the wisest of all the
world, it is an easie thing for you, every of you for me one day to
answer and with your wise answer every of you his day, my life may
save and keep; and in the eighth day I shall speak my self, and save
my life and all you from peril. As the Masters did behold that certain
star, they thought with themselves that the child had said truth,
saying, Almighty God be thanked, that the wisdom and cunning of our
Disciple exceedeth us all. Then said the first master Pantillus, Lord,
I shall speak for you the first day, and save your life. And Lentulus,
the second master said I shall for you the second day answer; and so
consequently every of them promised to answer for himself his day; and
this said, they cloathed the child in purple, leaped on horseback with
a fair company and hasted with the child to the Emperor.




[How the Emperor rode to meet his son coming from study with Joy,
Solemnity and Triumph.]


Whan themperour perceyued yᵗ his sone was comynge upon yᵉ waye, he rode
with grete joye to mete hym. The maysters vnderstandyng the comynge of
themperour sayd to the chylde, It is best that we departe, [et] in the
meane whyle we maye p_ro_uyde how we may saue your lyfe. The chylde
sayd it pleaseth me well that ye so doo, but haue mynde of me in tyme
of my necessyte. As they that herde, they toke theyr leue and departed
towardes yᵉ Cyte. The chylde came after accompanyed ryght honourably.
And as he and his fader themperour were mette, for joye [et] gladnesse
he toke hym about the necke [et] kyssed hym and sayd, My dere sone how
is it with you / is it (_sic_) longe sythen that I sawe you. He bowed
downe his hede and answerd no thynge. The fader had grete wonder why
that he spake not and thought in himselfe that his maysters had hym so
enformed that he rydynge sholde not speke. And whan they were comen to
the palays and were descended from theyr horses, The fader toke his
sone by the honde [et] lad hym in to the hall and set hym next hym
[et] behelde him and sayde, Say me how it is with your maysters, [et]
how they haue enformed you, for now it is many yeres syth I saw you.
He enclyned downe his hede [et] gaue none answere. The fader sayd,
wherfore speke ye not to me. And whan thempresse herde that themperours
sone was comen she was ryght joyous and glad, [et] sayd I wyl goo to
se hym. She apparaylled her with ryche vesture [et] atyre, [et] toke
with her two of her gentylwymen [et] went there as yᵉ emperour was
syttȳge wᵗ his sone she sette her downe by yᵉ chylde. [et] she sayd to
themperour is this your sone yᵗ hath ben nourysshed wᵗ yᵉ seuen wyse
maysters. [et] he sayd / it is my sone / but he speketh not. She sayd,
Delyuer to me your sone, [et] if euer he spake I shall do hym speke.
Tho sayd themperour ryse [et] go wᵗ her. The sone dyde reuere_n_ce to
yᵉ fader, as thoughe he sayd I am redy too accōplysshe your wyll, [et]
went wᵗ her.

Thempresse lad hym wᵗ her in to her chamber [et] commaunded all other

beloued dyoclesyan, I haue moche of your persone [et] beaute herde,
but now I am glad yᵗ I may se you wᵗ myn eyen that my herte coueyteth

knowledge that I for your loue vnto this daye haue kepte my vyrgynyte.
Speke to me [et] lete vs goo bed togyder. But he gaue her no worde to
answer. She seynge that sayd to hym, O good dyoclesyan haue the half
of my soule wherfore speke ye not to me / or at yᵉ leest shewe me some
token of loue / what shall I do, speke to me. I am redy to fulfyll and
perfourme your wyll. [et] whan she had thus sayd she embraced hy_m_
[et] wold haue kyssed hys mouth [et] he torned his vysage from her,
[et] in no wyse wolde cōsent. Tho sayd she ayen to hy_m_, O sone
wherfore do ye thus wᵗ me: beholde there is none yᵗ may se vs lete vs
togyder slepe / [et] than shall ye well p_er_ceyue yᵗ for your loue I
haue kept my vyrgynyte, and he torned his vysage frome her. She seynge
yᵗ he was of her ashamed shewed vnto hym her naked body and brestes and
sayde, beholde my sone what body I haue att your wylle, gyue me youre
consent or elles it shall be herde for me to passe with my ryght mȳde.
He neyther wᵗ sygne ne wᵗ countenaūce of vysage shewed her ony maner
of loue, but as much as he coude w_ith_drewe hy_m_ from her, whā she
sawe yᵗ she sayd, O my moste swete sone yf it please you not to cōsent
to me ne yet speke, haply for some resonable cause, Lo here is paper
pen [et] ynke yf ye wyl not speke wᵗ your mouth than wryte your wyl yᵗ
I ony tyme herafter may trust in your loue or not. The chylde wrote as
hereafter folowed, O lady god forbede yᵗ I sholde defoule my faders
orcheyerde, yf I shulde defoul it: I wote not what fruyte I shold haue
of it. I knowe wel one thȳge yᵗ I sholde syn̄ in yᵉ syghte of god

Howe Thempresse complayned to themperour of the shame to her done by

The Emperour was in his halle and herde the crye [et] noyse of
thempresse. he hastely ranne towardes his chambre [et] his knyghtes and
other of his seruauntes folowed hym after for to see what there was to
[be] done. Tho beganne thempresse to crye and to speke to themperour
thus, O my lorde haue pyte and compassyon vpon me, beholde this yonge
man is not your sone, but yᵉ foulest rybaude [et] harlot yᵗ euer was
borne, [et] a defouler of wymmen, for as ye knowe wel I lad and brought
hym with me in to my chamber, [et] sholde haue exhorted and caused
hym to haue spokē. I haue done asmoche therto as I can or may. [et]
whyles I with my wordes exhorted and meued hym for to haue spoken, he
hath endeuoyred hymself with me to haue synned. [et] by cause I wolde
not to hym consēte, but withstode as moche as I myght for to flee the
shame, he my vysage had made all blody, [et] my vesture and ornamentes
of my heed broken [et] all to torne, as ye may openly se: And yf ye had
not so sone comen vnto my callynge / he had accomplysshed in me his

fulfylled wᵗ grete malyce [et] woodnesse / commaunded his seruauntes
that they sholde lede hym to the galowes [et] hange hym. And after his
lordes herde that sayde / Lorde ye haue no moo but this sone only. It
is not good yᵗ ye thus lyghtely putt hym to deth / the lawe is put and
ordeyned for transgressours [et] mysdoers, and yf it be so that he must
edeye, lete hym by yᵉ lawe dye leest that it be sayd yᵗ themperour
in his grete furour and Ire without lawe and Justyce he hath put his
only sone to dethe. As themperour this herde commaunded him to be put
in pryson vnto the tyme that iugement were gyuen ayenst hym. And whan
thempresse vnderstode that the chylde was not put to dethe / she cryed
[et] weped bytterly [et] wold haue no reste. whan the nyght was comen
the Emperour entred in to his chamber to go to bed. and founde his wyfe
wepynge [et] sorowyng. To whome he sayde, O my mooste dere lady / for

your cursed sone hath me thus moche shame done [et] offended / and ye
haue commaunded hym too be hanged and yet he lyued / [et] your worde is

myght it happen to you as it dyd vpon a burgeys of Rome of whome an

That shall I doo gladly sayd the Empresse.




_The Fyrst Example of the Empresse._


[In the city of Rome was a Burgess which had a fair Garden, wherein
he had a noble Tree, the which every year brought forth fruit of good
vertue for whosoever eat thereof that were sick of any manner of
sickness or leprosie he should soon be whole and receive his sight. It
happened on a day, as the Burgess went into his garden to visit the
Tree, he espied under the Tree a fair young Imp, and called to him the
Gardiner and said: my friend, of this young Imp I give thee charge
for I trust of that to plant a better Tree than this is. The Gardiner
said: I shall it gladly do. Another time the Burgess came again into
his garden to visit the young Plant, and it appeared unto him that it
grew not so much as it should do, and he said to the Gardiner: how may
this be and he said, it is no wonder, for this great Tree hath so great
arms and branches, that the air may not come to the root of the young
tree, then said the Burgess, cut and hew off the arms and the boughs,
that the air may come thereto. The Gardiner did as he commanded. The
Burgess came again another time to see the young plant, and thought
that it grew never the better and said to the Gardiner, what is it that
letteth this plant not to grow now: and he said, I suppose the height
of the Old Tree letteth the Sun, that the rain may not come thereto,
and therefore it cannot grow. Then said the Master unto him, hew down
that tree to the ground, for I hope of this Plant to have a better than
ever] this was. The gardyner heryng his mayster obeyed hym, [et] hewe
downe the tree. And as this was done yᵗ yonge plant all holy perysshed
and came to nought. wherof came grete harme, for whan yᵉ poore [et] the
seke people perceyued yᵗ the tree was so destroyed they cursed all them
that were of counseyll [et] helpers therto / by the whiche they all
afore tyme were heled [et] cured of theyr infyrmytees [et] maladyes.
Then sayd the Empresse vnderstande ye what I haue sayd. Yes ryghte
well. Than sayd she, I shall declare to you what I haue sayde.

[Illustration]




_The Declaratyon of the Example._


This tree mylorde betokeneth your moste noble persone / that with your
counseyll and helpe many pore [et] seke folke are gretly holpen [et]
conforted. And the yonge ympe that vnder the grete tre is vp growen
is your cursed sone that now by his cunnynge begȳnith to growe and
studyeth how he fyrste may the armes and bowes of your myght cutte of /
and to wynne too hym the londe [et] praysynge of the people, and ouer
yᵗ he ymagyneth to destroy your person that he may hȳselfe reygne. But
what shall fall than therof come, all poore and feble people shall
curse all them the whiche myght haue destroyed your sone [et] haue
not done it / I counseyll you whyles ye are in your power [et] helth
yᵗ ye destroye hym leste yᵗ the curse of the people fall vpon you.
Tho sayde the Emperour, ye haue gyuen me good counseyll. Tomorowe I
shall condempne hym to the moost vylest deth that can be thought.
Whan yᵉ daye was come / yᵉ Emperour went [et] sate in Jugemēte, [et]
commaunded his seruauntes yᵗ they sholde lede his sone to be hanged wᵗ
trompettes blowynge in to kenynge of deth. And as themperours sone was
lad throughe the Cyte, the comen people began too wepe [et] crye alas
yᵉ onely sone of themperour is lad towardes his deth / [et] therwithal
came Pancyllas rydyng vpon a hors yᵉ fyrste mayster. Whan the chylde
sawe hym / he bowed his hede to hym, as though he had sayde, Haue
mynde vpon me whan ye come afore my fader, se how I am lad towardes
the galowes. Than yᵉ mayster sayd to the seruauntes / make no haste,
for I hope by the grace of god this day to delyuer hym frō the deth.
Then sayde all the people, O good mayster haste you to yᵉ palays and
saue your dyscyple. he smote his hors with yᵉ spores tyll he came to
the palays [et] kneled before the Emperour [et] dyde hym reuerence / To
whome themperour sayd, It shall neuer be to the good, which answerd I
haue deserued a better rewarde. The Emperour sayd there lyest yᵘ, for I
delyuered to the [et] thy felowes my sone well spekynge / [et] in alle
thyng well manered, [et] now he is dompe / [et] that wors is, he wolde
haue oppressed my wyf, therfore this day he shall dye, [et] ye all
shall dye a shameful dethe. The mayster sayd, O lord as for your sone
yᵗ ye saye that he speketh not, yᵗ knoweth god, [et] without a cause
it is not as ye shall vnderstande. And that ye saye more yᵗ he your
Empresse wolde haue befowled. I shall saye you of a trouth, he hath ben
in our company by yᵉ space of xvi yeres [et] we neuer coude perceyue
suche thinges by hym. And therfore my dere lorde I shall shew you one
thynge that yf ye put your sone to deth for yᵉ wordes of your wyfe, it
sholde happen too you wors than to a knyght the whiche that kylled his
best grey hounde thrugh the wordes of his wyfe whiche saued his sone
from yᵉ deth. Tho sayd themperour to yᵉ mayster tell me yᵗ example. The
Mayster sayd, Lorde that shall I not do / for afore or I coude make an
ende therof your sone myght be dede [et] thenne in vayne [et] without
fruyte I sholde reherce it, but yf it please you this notable example
to here / call ayen her sone tyll to morowe [et] as ye thynke by reason
then do with hym youre pleasure. As themperour that herde anone he lete
the chylde too be called ayen [et] in the meane tyme he sette hym in
pryson whyles the mayster sholde fynisshe his tale. And then he beganne

_The Example of the Fyrste Mayster._


There was a valyaunt knyght whiche had oonly one soone as ye haue.
The whiche he loued so moche that he ordeyned for his kepynge thre
nourysshes, the fyrste sholde gyue hym souke [et] fede hym, yᵉ seconde
sholde wasshe hym [et] kepe hym clene, yᵉ thirde sholde brynge hym to
slepe [et] to reste. This knyghte had also a greyhounde [et] a fawcon
yᵗ he also loued ryghte well. The greyhounde was so good yᵗ he neuer
ran too noo game but he toke it [et] helde it tyl his mayster came. And
yf his mayster dysposed hym to go to batayle, yf he sholde not spede
in yᵉ batayll / anone as he sholde mounte vpon his horse yᵉ greyhounde
wold take the horse tayll in his mouth [et] drawe backwarde / [et]
wolde also cry [et] howle meruaylously loude. By thise sygnes the
knyght vnderstode yf that he sholde spede in his iourneye or not. The
faucon was so gentyll and so hardy that he was neuer caste of to his
praye but he toke it. This same knyght had grete plesure in iustynge
[et] turneynge, so yᵗ vpon a tyme vnder his castell he lete proclame
a tornement to the whiche came many good lordes and knyghtes. The
knyght entred in to yᵉ tourney, [et] his lady went with her maydens to
se it. And as they went out after went the nourysshes [et] lefte the
chylde lyenge alone in the cradell in the halle where the greyhounde
laye nygh the wall, and yᵉ hauke or faucon standynge vpon a perke. In
this halle there was a serpente lurkynge or hydde in a hole. to all
them of the castell vnknowen. The whiche whā felte that they were all
absent he put out his hede of his hole. [et] as he noman sawe but the
chylde lyenge in yᵉ cradell, he went out of his cauerne towardes yᵉ
cradell for the chylde to haue slayne. The noble faucon seynge that,
behelde yᵉ grehounde that was slepȳge/ she made suche a noyse [et]
rustelynge with her winges or feders yᵗ the greyhounde awoke and rose
vp. and whan he sawe the serpente nyghe the chylde anone ayenst hym he
lepte / [et] they bothe faught so long togyder tyll yᵗ the serpente
hadde greuously hurted and wounded the greyhounde that he bled sore.
soo yᵗ the erthe about the cradell was al be bled with the blode of the
greyhounde. The greyhounde whan that he felte hymselfe so greuously
hurted and wounded, sterte fyersly vpon the serpente, and faught sore
togyder and so egerly, so that betwyne theym the cradell was ouer caste
wᵗ the chylde the botome vpwarde. And by (_sic_) bycause yᵗ the cradell
had foure pomelles or fete they saued the chyldes vysage [et] his lyfe
frome ony hurtȳge fallynge towardes the erthe. [et] what shall I say
more. Incontynent therafter with grete payne the greyhounde ouercame
[et] slewe the serpente / [et] went [et] layd hym downe ayen in his
place [et] lycked his woundes / and anone after as yᵉ iustes [et]
torneye was done, the nourysshes were the fyrste that came in to yᵉ
castell / [et] as they sawe the cradell reuersed with bloode vppon
the erthe enuyronned, and that the greyhounde was also blody, they
thought and sayde amonges themselfe that the greyhounde hadde slayne
the chylde, and they were not soo wyse as too tourne vppe ayen the
cradell with the chylde for too haue seene what was therof befallen.
But they sayd / lete vs fle or ren away leest that oure mayster put or
laye the blame vpon vs and slee vs. And as they were thus away rennynge
/ they met wᵗ the knyghtes wyfe, and she sayd to them Wherfore make ye
this sorowe [et] whether wyl ye ren, [et] they sayde, O lady woo and
sorowe be to vs and to you; why what is there happened, shewe me. The
grehounde they sayd that our lorde [et] mayster loueth soo moche hath
deuoured and slayne your sone / [et] lyeth by the wall all full of the
bloode. As yᵉ lady this herde she fell to the erthe and began to wepe
and crye pyteously: [et] sayd alas, O my dere sone be ye thus slayne
[et] dede, what shall I nowe make that I haue my onely sone thus loste.
Herwithall came in the knyght frome the torneye, [et] beholdyng his
lady thus cryenge [et] makyng sorowe. he demaūded her wherfore that
she made so grete sorowe and lamentacyon. She answered hym, O my lorde
youre greyhounde that ye loue soo moche hath slayne your onely sone,
[et] lyeth by the wal sacyate with bloode of the chylde. The knyght
hugely angred went in to the hall, [et] the greyhounde went to hym to
mete and to fawne as he was wonte to doo. And the knyght drewe out his
swerde [et] with one stroke smote of the houndes heede, and went to ye
cradell and founde his sone al hole, and by the cradell the serpente
slayne. And by dyuers sygnes perceyued that the hounde hadde foughten
ayenst the serpent for the saluacyon of yᵉ chylde. Then with grete
sorowe [et] wepyng he tare his here and sayd woo be to me that for
the wordes of my wyfe I haue slayne my good greyhounde yᵉ whiche hath
saued my chyldes lyfe [et] hath slayne the serpente. Herfore I wyll
put my selfe to penaunce [et] brake his swerde in thre peces, and went
towardes yᵉ holy londe, [et] abode there all the dayes of h_i_s lyfe.
Then sayd yᵉ mayster to themperour, Lorde vnderstande ye what I haue
sayd. And he answerd and sayde ryght well. The mayster sayd: Yf yᵗ ye
do youre sone to dethe for yᵉ wordes of your wyfe, it shall come to you
wors than it dyde too the knyght for his greyhounde. The Emperour sayde
ye haue shewed me a fayre example, [et] wᵗout doute this daye shall not
my sone dye. Tho sayd the mayster yf ye do so ye do wysly, but I thanke
you that ye haue hym spared this daye for my sake:

Whan yᵗ thempresse herde yᵗ the chylde was not yet deede, she began
to wepe bytterly [et] sate her downe vpon the erthe in ye asshes [et]
wolde not holde vppe her heed. As themperour that herde he entred in
to yᵉ chāber [et] sayd to her, O good wyfe wherfore make ye all this
sorowe [et] trouble your selfe so moche. She sayd demaunde ye me that

happened vpon a shepeherde and a boore. The emperour sayd, I praye you
shewe me that exāple for my lernynge. and she sayd yesterday I shewed
one: and I sawe none effecte that therof came, too what entente sholde
I now shewe. Neuertheles I shal this notable example telle [et] declare

_The Seconde Example of the Empresse._


There was somtyme an Emperour the whiche had a grete foreste / wherin
was a bore yᵗ was so cruell [et] so fell that all men goynge through
the forest he kylled and deuoured. The emperour was therof ryght heuy,
and lete to proclame thrugh all his empyre, that who soeuer he was
that coude sle the bore sholde haue his oonly doughter too wyfe, [et]
therto his Empyre after his deth. [et] as this in all places proclamed
was there was not one man founde yᵗ durste medle or intromytte. Than
was there a shepeherde whyche in hymself thought, myght I this bore
sle [et] wyn̄ sholde not only auaunce my self, but also al my
generatyon [et] kynred. he toke his shepeherdes staf in his honde, and
went in to the forest. And as the boore had of hym a syght, he drew
hym towardes the herdman, and he for fere clymmed vpon a tree. Than
the bore began to byte and gnawe the tree / so that the herde thought
shortely that he sholde haue ouer throwe it. This tre was laden wᵗ
grete plente of fruyte. The herde gadred and plucked therof and cast
them to yᵉ boore. In so moche that whan he had fylled hym therwith he
put and layde hym downe to slepe. The whiche perceyuynge the herde by
lytell [et] lytell he descended [et] with the one hande he clawed the
bore, [et] with yᵉ other he helde hymselfe on the tre / [et] seynge yᵗ
the boore slepte soundly [et] faste, drewe out his knyfe and smote yᵉ
bore to yᵉ herte [et] kylled hȳ. [et] wedded thēperours doughtʳ to hys
wyf: [et] aftʳ yᵉ deth of her fadʳhe was made emperour. tho sayd she
my lorde wote ye not what I haue sayd. He sayd ryght well. Then sayd
she, this myghty bore betokeneth your mooste noble persone / ayenst
whome maye no man withstande neyther by wysdom ne with strength. This
shepherde with hys staffe is the persone of your vngracyous sone, which
wᵗ his staff of connȳge begynneth to play wᵗ you as yᵉ herdman clawed
the bore and made him to slepe [et] after kylled hym. In yᵉ same maner
yᵉ maysters of your sone by theyr fals fables and narracyons clawe
[et] glose vnto the tyme that your sone slee you, that he may regne.
Tho sayd themperour god forbede yᵗ they sholde doo too me as they dyde
to yᵉ bore. [et] sayd vnto her this day my sone shall be hanged. And
she answered yf ye do so ye do wysely. Than themperour yᵉ seconde tyme
syttȳge in iugement, cōmaunded to lede hys [son] to yᵉ galowes [et]
hange hym. And whyles he was goȳge, the seconde mayster came before
themperour doynge hym reuerence as it is before shewed in yᵉ comȳge
of the fyrste mayster. To whom yᵉ seconde mayster sayd O my lorde
themperour yf ye sholde do sle your sone for the wordes of your wyfe,
it myghte worst come to you than it dyde to a knyght which for the
wordes of his wyfe was vniustly put in a pyller. Themperoure sayd, O
good mayster tell me how it hapned. And he sayde my lorde I shall not
saye it but yf yᵗ ye will doo call ayen your sone from yᵉ deth vnto the
tyme yᵗ thexample be tolde, the whiche yf it tourne you not frome your
purpose, your wyll be fulfylled. The emperour cōmaūded yᵗ yᵉ chylde
sholde be called ayen. And [after this manner following, the second

[_The Example of the Second Master._


[In a City was an ancient Knight, which wedded a young wife and fair,
as ye hath done, whom he loved above all earthly things; the knight
was a very circumspect and careful husband insomuch that every night
he locked the door with his own hands and laid the keys under his
Beds-head. In that City was a law or custom, that at a certain hour
in the night, a bell was used to be rung, that after the ringing of
the said bell, if any man or woman were by the watch-men found about
the streets, all that night they should be kept in prison, and on the
morrow set upon the Pillory, that all people might behold them.

[The said Knight had little lust of fleshly deeds, for he was very
old, and might not satiate or perform the desires and appetites of his
young wife; wherefore every night she having a Paramour, her Husband
sleeping, took the keys from under his Beds-head, and went to her love;
and when she came again, laid the keys under her husband's head; and
thus they played many a time.

[It happened upon a night that the knight awaked from his sleep, and
missed his wife, and the keys and his Beds-head, whereupon he rose
up and went unto the doors, and found them open, the which he bolted
fast within, and went up again into his chamber, and looked out of
the window towards the street: and when it was near the third cocks
crow, his wife came from her best beloved, and found the door shut and
bolted within: then was she] sorowfull. neuerthelesse she knocked to
haue come in. Tho spake the knyght out of the wyndowe. O yᵘ moste euyll
[et] vnclene wyfe, now I knowe [et] am experte that many a tyme ye haue
forsaken my bedde [et] gone and done auoutrye. now shall ye stande
tyll the bel be rongen and yᵗ the wakers may take you and doo with you
according to the lawe. The wyfe answered, My lorde wherfore lay ye that
to me. In trouth I shall saye you I was called by my moders mayden
[et] fetched in the nyght, [et] whan I sawe that ye slepte so swetely
I durste not awake you bycause that ye are olde, and therfore I toke
yᵉ keyes [et] went to my moder the whyche is sore seke, that I fere
too morowe she must bee anoynted or aneeled notwithstandyng for that I
sholde not you offende or dysplease I haue hasted me aye_n_ to you [et]
haue lefte her lyenge in grete payne [et] infyrmyte. Therfore I pray
you for the loue of god lete me in afore the bel be rongen. The knyght
answered So shall ye not come in, ye muste there abyde vnto the tyme
that the bell be rongen, [et] tyll that yᵉ wakers come and take you.
The she sayde that sholde be to you [et] to me: to all our frendes
[et] kynred a grete shame and rebuke. Therfore atte the reuerence of
almyghty god lete me come in. Than sayd he, Haue in thy mȳde euil and
false wyfe how oftentymes ye haue forsaken my bedde and doone auoutrye.
It is moche better that ye suffer shame and beewayle for youre synnes
here in this worlde, thanne for too suffer payne in helle. She sayd
ayen to hȳ I praye you for the loue of hȳ yᵗ was crucyfyed [et] dyed
vpon the crosse haue mercy vpon me. The knyght answered, ye laboure
all in vayn̄ for ye shall not come in, but ye shall tary the comynge
the wakers. As she herde that, she sayde my lorde ye knowe well that
by this dore standyth a well, yf ye lete me not come in I shall therin
drowne my selfe, rather thanne all my frendes sholde be shamed for
me. Then̄e sayd he, wolde god yᵗ ye had be drowned long afore or ye
in my bedde came. And as they thus spake togyder, yᵉ mone went down
[et] was al derke. Tho sayde she, yf it wyll none otherwyse be I shal
drowne miselfe, but yet afore as a trewe crysten woman I wylle make my
testament. Fyrst I bequethe to god [et] to oure lady my soule, my body
too be buryed in yᵉ chyrche of saynt Peter [et] of all other thȳges
[et] goodes yᵗ god hath sent me, I gyue vnto you to dyspose for my
soule after your wysdome [et] dyscrecyon, [et] whan she had thus sayd,
she went to the well, [et] a grete stone ther beynge wᵗ bothe her armes
she lyfte vp [et] sayd, Nowe I drowne myselfe, [et] caste yᵉ stone
downe in to the well [et] went ayen pryuely and stode by the dore. The
knyghte herynge that noyse cryed wᵗ a lowde voyce saynge / alas alas
my wyfe is drowned, and hastely came downe and rāne to the well. And
whan she sawe that the dore was open, anone she entred and locked and
made faste yᵉ yate / [et] went vp to yᵉ chamber [et] laye [et] loked
out of yᵉ wyndowe. The knyghte stode by yᵉ welle [et] cryed and wepte
bytterly and sayd, woo be to me I haue now loste my moost beloued wyfe,
cursed be the tyme that I made faste the dore ayenst her. The lady
herde that [et] sayd, O ye cursed olde grysarde, why stade ye there
this tyme on yᵉ nyght, was not my body to you suffycyent, wherfore goo
ye thus euery nyghte, out to your harlottes [et] hores and leue my
bed. As he herde the voyce of his wyfe he was ryght gladde and sayd
Blessed be god that yet she is not drowned. But my good lady wherfore
laye ye suche thynges ayenst me. I thoughte to haue chastysed you, and
therfore I locked the dore. But in no wyse I entended your peryl / ye
knowe well whatte sorowe I made for you whan I herde you to haue fallen
in the well, [et] therfore I came lyghtly to haue holpen you. Therupon
she sayde, falsly ye lye. I neuer dyde suche thinges as ye laye to me.
But it appereth by a comyn prouerbe, he yᵗ is defectyfe or culpable
hymself in a synne, he iugeth euery man to be in the same, or elles
yᵗ fader soughte neuer his sone in yᵉ ouen: but yf he had ben therin
hȳselfe. And therfore ye put that to me yᵗ ye yourselfe haue oftentymes
done [et] vsed but one thynge I promys you. ye shall abyde there tyll
yᵉ wakers come, [et] that yᵉ bell be rongen that they may lede you
before yᵉ iuges to abyde [et] suffer the law. Tho sayd the knyght,
wherfore laye ye suche thynges too me / I am olde [et] all my lyfe
dayes I haue ben conuersaunt in this cyte, [et] in this was I neuer
dyffamed, [et] therfore lete me in that to me ne to your self ye do
no shame. She sayd, ye speke in vayne, It is better that ye forthynke
your sȳnes in this worlde than in hell. Haue in mynde what the wyse
man sayth. A poore man proude, A ryche man a lyer, An olde man a fole
god hatyth. So ye be a lyer and ryche. what nede was it too you for
too lye vpon me. And ye are a fole, for ye had yᵉ floure of my youth
at your pleasure, and yet ye muste renne to hoores [et] harlottes. And
therfore it is a grete grace of god that ye haue tyme and space too
forthynke it, leste that ye sholde perysshe and be dampned for eurmore.
[et] for yᵗ suffre your penaunce pacyently. Tho knyght sayd, O my best
and well beloued lady all though it be so, yet is god mercyfull, and
he asketh noo thynge of a synner, but he amende his lyfe and forthynke
and doo penaunce for his synnes. Nowe lete me come in and I wyll make
amendes, She sayde, Whiche deuyll hath made you so good a prechour,
So come ye not in. And as they thus spake the bell was rongen / yᵉ
knyght herynge that sayd, O my mooste dere lady the bell ryngeth now,
suffer me to come in that I be not ashamed for euer. whiche answered,
yᵉ ryngȳge of the bell pretendeth the helthe of youre soule take it
pacyently in your penaūce. And as this was sayd come yᵉ wakers yᵗ
aboute the cyte went [et] founde the knyght standynge in yᵉ strete [et]
sayd to hy_m_, O good man it is not gode yᵗ ye in this houre of yᵉ
nyght stande here. And as she herde the voyce of yᵉ wakers / she sayd,
Good felowes venge me on yᵗ olde cursed horehunter [et] rybaude, for ye
knowe whose doughter and what I am. This cursed olde man is wont euery
nyght to leue my bed, [et] gothe to his hoores [et] harlottes. I haue
longe forborne hym and wolde not shewe it ne complayne vpon hym too my
frendes, for I trusted that he wolde haue amēded his mysrule, [et] it
helpeth not. And therfore take hym [et] punysshe hym after the lawe, yᵗ
all suche olde dotardes may take example by hym. Then yᵉ wakers toke
hym and all nyght chastysed hym in pryson. [et] on yᵉ morne they put
hym on yᵉ pyllery. Tho sayd to the Emperoure, Lorde haue ye ynderstonde
what I haue sayd [et] he sayd ryght well. Tho sayd yᵉ mayster, yf ye
put to dethe your sone by yᵉ excytacyon of your wyfe, it shall to you
worse come than it dyd to yᵉ knyght. The Emperour sayd she was the
worste woman yᵗ euer I herde of that so falsely her husbande brought
to shame [et] rebuke. I say to you mayster yᵗ for yᵉ reason of this
example, my sone shall this daye not dye. The mayster sayd to hym,
yf ye do so than do ye wysely. And yᵗ herafter ye shall ioye, [et] I
commende you to god / [et] thanke you of your pacyent herynge / and of
the sparynge of your sone and so he departed.




_The Thyrd Complaynte of the Empresse._


Whan thempresse herde yᵗ the chylde was not dede she wepte bytterly
[et] entred in to her preuy chamber / [et] tare her skyn wᵗ her nayles,
[et] wᵗ loude voyce cryed and sayd alas yᵗ euer I was borne, [et] yᵗ I
soo grete a kynges doughter sholde thus be intreated [et] shamed and
therof can haue no remedy. Her gētilwȳmen th_i_s herȳg wēt [et] shewed

O lady wepe not so ne cry not, for it becometh you no thynge / whiche
sayd / the loue that I haue [et] owe to you maketh me more to sorowe
than the contempte of the dede. for why the inwarde loue of your herte
hath hytherto prohybite [et] letted me yᵗ I haue not retorned ayen in
to my countree to my fader but I fere yf I sholde so do to you it myght
do harme for he is myghty to honoure me wᵗ rychesses, and too venge my
quarell [et] despyte in such wyse yᵗ ye [et] youres myght forthynke it.
Therto sayd themperour lete that goo out of your mynde, shewe it not /
for as long as I lyue I shall neuer fayle you. And she sayd / lorde
I praye god that ye maye longe lyue. But I fere me yᵗ it shall hapen
vpon you as it dyde of a knyght and of his sone that wolde not burye
his faders hede in the chyrcheyerde, a_n_d yet his fader was for hym

he wolde not burye his faders heede / she sayd I shall do it to your

_The Thyrde Example of the Empresse._


There was in the cyte of rome a knyghte yᵗ had two doughters [et] one
sone. this knyghte hadde so grete delyte in hauntinge iustynge and
turneynge that all thynge that he myght wynne [et] gete he layde it and
spente it therupon. In that tyme was an emperour named Octauyan, whiche
in rychesse of golde [et] syluer exceded al other kynges and prynces
in so moche that he had a toure full of golde, and ordeyned a knyght
to haue yᵉ kepynge [et] charge therof. This knyghte that so haunted
iustynge [et] other ydell games came to so grete pouerte that he was
dysposed to sel his herytage, [et] called to hym his sone and sayd.
My sone it behoueth me of your counseyll, for necessyte and pouerte
compelleth me to sell myn herytage, or elles for to fynde an other way
by the whiche I maye lyue, for yf I sholde sell myn heritage ye [et]
your systers sholde perysshe. The sone sayde, fader yf ye can fynde
ony other meane without sellynge of the herytage, I sholde be redy to
helpe you. To whome yᵉ fader sayd I am bethought vpon a good counseyll.
Themperour hath a toure full of golde / by nyght tyme lete vs go
thyder with instrumentes and dygge and hewe through the toure, and lete
vs take of the golde as moche as shal suffyse us. Therto answered the
sone [et] sayd, that coūseyl can not be amended, for it is better of
themperoures golde to take to helpe vs than our herytage to sell. They
rose vp bothe in a nyght and went to the toure and with instrumentes
they made there thrugh an hole, and toke as moche golde as they bothe
coude cary away at that tyme. The knyght payed his dettes [et] haunted
ayen iustes as he dyde before tyll all was spēte and consumed. In the
meane whyle the keper of yᵉ tresoure went in to the toure [et] whan he
saw the tresoure stolen, [et] a grete hole made through the wall, he
began to waxe sore aferde [et] went to themperour and shewed how it
was befallen. To whome themperour sayd all angrely, what nedest yᵘ to
shewe that haue I not delyuered to the my tresoure / [et] therfore of
the I wyll aske it. Tho anone as the keper herde that went to the toure
ayen, [et] set afore the hole a grete vessel ful of pytche medled with
other gummes so subtely, that noo man myght come in at that hole but
that he must nedes fall into that vessell, [et] yf he therin fyll he
coude no more come out of it. Not longe after the knyghte had all the
golde consumed and spent [et] went ayen with his sone to the toure to
stele more golde. And as the fader went in fyrste, anone he was fallen
in yᵉ ves_sel_ with pytche to the necke. [et] whan he saw that he was
taken and coude not gete out he sayd to his sone, folow me not, for
yf thou doost thou may not escape to be taken. Than yᵉ sone sayd, god
defende it yᵗ I sholde not helpe you: for yf ye are founden we are
all but dede, [et] yf that ye may not be holpen by me, I shall seke
counseyll how that ye may be delyuered [et] holpen. The fader sayd /
there is none other counseyll, but with thy swerde smyte of myne heed /
and as my body is founde without hede, noo man shall knowe me. [et] so
yᵘ and my dought_er_s may escape [et] auoyde th_i_s wordly shame [et]
dethe. The sone sayde, Fader ye haue gyuen yᵉ best counseyll, For yf
it were so that ony man myght perceyue ony knolege of you, none of vs
sholde escape yᵉ deth [et] therfore it is expedient that your hede be
smyten of. Anone he drewe out his swerde [et] smote of his faders hede
[et] caste it into a pytte. [et] afterwarde hyd it therin and yede and
shewed to his systers all the mater, whiche many dayes after pryuely
bewayled the dethe of theyr fader. After this yᵉ keper of yᵉ tresour
came in to the toure [et] founde a body wᵗout ony hede. whereof he
wondred sore, and shewed it to yᵉ emperour. To whome he sayde, byn̄de
that body at the tayle of an horse [et] so drawe it by al the stretes
of the cyte, [et] dyligently take good hede yf ye here ony crye or
wepynge. wheresoo euer ye here that he is lorde of the house, take all
them [et] wᵗ the body drawe them to the galowes [et] hange them. The
whiche themperours seruauntes fulfylled accordinge to his cōmaūdemēt.
And as they came ayenst the house of the dede knyght, [et] as the
doughters sawe yᵉ body of theyre dede fader, they made a merueylous
grete shryche [et] wept pyteously [et] as ther broder that herd, anone
he wounded hymself greuously in the mouthe with a knyfe, so that grete
plente of bloode came oute of the wounde. The offycers whan the herde
that noyse [et] crye entred in to the house, and demaunded the cause of
theyr noyse [et] clamour. Tho answered the sone that I am thus wounded,
for whan my systers sawe my bloode so habundauntly go oute as ye see,
they began to wepe and crye. And whan the offycers sawe the wounde
they byleued his wordes, [et] so dysceyued went theyr wayes, and hynge
(_sic_) the body of the knyght vpon the galowes where it hynge long
tyme [et] his sone wolde neyther take his body downe frome the galowes,
ne yet bury his hede. yᵉ Empresse sayd vnderstande ye what I haue sayd.
Themperour sayd ye ryght well.

 _The Declaratyon of the Example._


Tho spake thempresse, thus my lorde I fere me it shalbe of you [et] of
your sone. This knyght for loue of his sone was made poore. [et] fyrste
he commytted thefte [et] brake the toure, secondary dyde hymself too be
heded, that his chyldren sholde haue no shame. After yᵉ sone cast his
hede in a dyke, [et] buryed it nether in chyrche nor in chyrcheyerde,
his body he suffred to hange styll vpon the galowes, yf that he coude
not haue taken it downe in the daye he myght wel haue done in yᵉ nyght.
In the same maner ye laboure nyght and day that ye maye promote your
sone to honoure [et] ryches. But without doubte he dayly laboureth for
your confusyon [et] destructyon that he may regne after you in your
empyre. Therfore I aduyse you yᵗ ye do hȳ to be hanged before or he
you destroye. Themperour sayd ye haue shewed me a good example. The
knyghtes sone whan he had smyten of his faders hede wolde not bury it.
Without doute my [son] fader (_sic_) shall not do so by me, but he
communded (_sic_) anone his offycers that they sholde lede hym to the
galowes. [et] they obeyed his cōmaūdement hastely. [et] as they lad
hym thrugh the stretes yᵉ people made grete noyse [et] lamentacyon.
alas alas the onely sone of the emperour is lad ayen towardes yᵉ
galowes / [et] as they thus ladde hym the thyrde mayster named Craton
came rydȳg vpon an hors / [et] as yᵉ chylde sawe hym he bowed downe
his hede to hym as though he had sayd, haue mynde vpon me. The pepole
cryed say_i_ng, O good mayster hast you [et] saue youre dyscyple. He
smote his horse wᵗ spores [et] haysted him to yᵉ palays. And whan he
came before themperoure he honourably salued hym, whiche sayd, thy
comyng hyther shall neuer auayll the / nor it that yᵘ comest for. The
mayster sayd, I hoped in my comynge to haue be welcome [et] haue had
a better rewarde [et] not too haue be rebuked. The emperour sayd / as
ye haue deserued so shal it be to you. To whom he sayd, my lord what
haue I deserued. Themperour sayde, ye haue ryghte well deserued deth,
for why I delyuered to you my sone well spekynge [et] wel manered for
to enfourme and teche, [et] ye haue delyuered hym ayen too me dompe
[et] a rybaude. To whom the mayster sayd / in that ye say he is dompe
yᵗ I commytte to god / for he maketh the dompe to speke [et] the defe
to here. But in that ye saye yᵗ he wolde haue your wyfe enforced that
wolde I gladly knowe yf ony creature haue yᵗ seen, for there is no
malyce aboue yᵉ malyce of a woman / and that shall I proue by a good
example that wȳmen are full of lesȳges [et] decepcōns, [et] yf ye put
to deth your sone for the wordes of your wyfe / it shall happen to
you as it dyd to a noble man of his wyfe [et] of his pye, the whiche
he loued merueylously. To whome themperour sayd, you tell me how that
wymmen are full of malyce [et] lesynges / whiche sayd I wyll not do it
/ but yf ye fyrst calle ayen your sone frome the dethe, [et] then at
youre pleasure I shall shewe thexample. Than themperour anone made the
chylde too be called ayen and put in pryson. Than the mayster began to
say this example in this fourme folowynge.

_The Example of the Thyrde Mayster._


There was in a cyte a ryche burgeys that had a pye the which he loued
so moche yᵗ euery day he taught her to speke latyn [et] hebrewe. And
whan yᵗ she had lerned perfetly to speke those two langages / all yᵗ
she sawe [et] herde, she shewed [et] tolde to her mayster. This good
man had a fayre yonge wyfe as ye haue / the whiche he loued moche. but
she contrary loued not hym / bycause he myght not furnysshe her of
such pleasures [et] lustes as she desyred to haue. And therfore had
she an other fayre yonge man that she loued aboue her husbōde. And
alwayes as her husbonde was out of the towne about his marchaundyse
[et] other besynesses to do, and she sent for her best beloued yᵗ they
myght togyder make good chere. The pye as she that sawe tolde it to her
mayster, at his home comyng, in such wyse that yᵉ noyse ranne all ouer
the cyte of her aduoutry, wherof her husbōde many tyme brauled [et]
chydde her. She answered hȳ, ye beleue your cursed pye, whiche as longe
as she lyueth shall alwayes make betwix us varyaunce [et] dyscorde.
And he sayd the pye can not lye, for that she seeth [et] hereth that
she telleth me, and therfore I beleue her more than you. It fortuned
that the good man went in to ferre coūtrees to do his marchaūdyse, [et]
as sone as was gone his wyfe sent for her frende [et] loue to solace
[et] make good chere wᵗ hȳ. but he durst not come by day lyght. but
abode to yᵉ euenynge leste that he sholde be seen [et] marked of yᵉ
peple. And as yᵉ nyght was comen / he knocked at yᵉ gate: [et] she was
redy [et] opened it [et] sayd, Go in frely for n̄o man shall see you.
[et] he sayd I fere me yᵗ the cursed pye shall accuse vs, for by her
is comen grete sclaundre vpon vs through out all the cyte. Entre in
she sayd boldely and fere not. And as he sholde passe through yᵉ halle
where the pye was in her cage, she herd hym say thyse wordes. O my
moste beloued I fere me gretely of yᵉ pye that she shal bewraye vs. And
as the wyfe herde that she sayde, Be styll foole. it is derke she may
not se you. Then̄e yᵉ py that herynge sayde, If I se the not I here
thy voyce, [et] thou doost wrong to my mayster, for yᵘ slepest with
my maystresse, and whan̄e my mayster cometh I shall tell hym. The
yonge man herynge that sayd, Tolde I not you yᵗ the pye sholde dyscouer
vs. And yᵉ wyfe sayd fere not for this nyght we shall be auenged vpon
the pye. And entred in to yᵉ chamber [et] slepte togyder that nyght.
About mydnyghte the wyfe arose, [et] called to her a mayden and sayde /
fetche me a ladder [et] set vp too yᵉ rofe of yᵉ house yᵗ I may wreke
me on the pye. The mayde dyde so and they bothe went vp [et] made an
hole through the coueryng of yᵉ house ryght ouer the pye / and there
thrugh caste sande clay stones [et] water vpon the pye, somoch that the
poore pye was nere dede [et] on the morne the yonge man went erly out
at a backe dore. And whan the good man was comen home as his custume
was he went [et] vysyted his pye and sayd to her, O pye my welbeloued
byrde / say me howe yᵘ haste fared the whiles that I haue been out. She
sayd, mayster I shall tel you tydynges that I haue herde. your wyfe as
sone as ye were gone by the nyght tyme she lete a man come i_n_ and as
I that herde I tolde hym yᵗ I wolde shewe it to you at your comynge
home / that not withstondynge she lad hym in to your chamber, [et]
slepte with hȳ al nyght. ye demaunded me also howe yᵗ I haue done in
your absence. And I saye you of a trouth that I was neuer so nygh my
deth as I was that same nyght wᵗ snowe hayle [et] rayne yᵗ fyll vpon
my body, so longe durȳge that I was almoste left for dede. The wyfe
whā she herde that sayd too her husbonde, Syr ye byleue your pye now
may ye here what she sayth / she cōplaynyth yᵗ in yᵉ same nyght there
fyll so moche snowe hayle [et] rayne vpon her yᵗ she was almost dede,
[et] yet ther was none of thē al that same nyght, for ther was not
in a yere a fayrer ne a clerer nyght than it was [et] therfore from
hensforth byleue her not. Tho went yᵉ good man to his neyghbours [et]
demaūded of them yf yᵗ nyght were ony tempest or rayne. They answered
yᵗ some of them had waked all yᵉ nyght, [et] in all yᵗ yere they had
not sene a fayrer nyght. Tho we_n_t he to his house [et] sayd to his
wyfe, I haue foūden you in yᵉ trouth for yᵉ nyght was fayr [et] clere
as I vndersto_n_de of your neyghbours. ye may now knowe of a trouth
sayd she yᵗ py is a lyer. wᵗ her lesȳges she hath sowen [et] made
discorde betwix vs, [et] ouer that I am diffamed thrugh yᵉ cite by her
fals lesy_n_gs. than yᵉ burgeys we_n_t to yᵉ pye [et] sayd wherfore
haste yᵘ made lyes [et] fals tales betwix me [et] my wyfe. Is this yᵉ
thāke that I haue for yᵉ mete that I was wont to gyue yᵉ wᵗ myn owne
hōdes euery day [et] haste also therby my wyfe brought in to grete
dyffamacyon thrugh al the towne. The pye answered, god knoweth yᵗ I
can not lye for that I sawe [et] herde yᵗ haue I shewed to you. Than
sayd he, yᵘ lyest. Haste thou not sayd vnto me that in yᵉ same nyghte
was hayle [et] snowe [et] rayne that yᵘ haddest nerehōnde loste thy
lyfe whiche is false. And therfore from hensforth yᵘ shalt make no mo
lesynges ne dyscorde betwix me and my wyfe / [et] toke yᵉ pye and brake
her necke. As the wyfe sawe that she was ryght glad [et] sayd now haue
ye done well, now maye we all our lyue dayes lyue in reste [et] peas.
And whan he had slayne yᵉ pye, he loked vp [et] sawe in the top of yᵉ
house a laddre [et] a vessel wᵗ water, sand [et] stones. and as he that
behelde, he perceyued the falshede of his wyfe, and cryed with a loude
voyce, Woo be too me that for my wyues wordes I haue my pye slayne
and all my solace and ioye loste. yᵉ why (_sic_) the in all thynges
sayd to me trouthe. And as he had thus doone anone for sorowe lefte
his marchaundyse and all his house and went to wardes the holy londe,
and neuer retorned ayen towardes his wyfe. Than̄e the mayster sayd
to themperour, Syr haue ye vnderstande what I haue sayd. he answered
ryght well. the mayster sayd, was not yᵗ a false [et] cursed wyfe yᵗ
so by her lesynges caused yᵉ pye for to be slayne. The emperour sayd,
In trouthe she was full of falsenesse. I forthynke gretly the pye, the
whiche for her true saynge lost her lyfe. Verely I say to you yᵗ ye
haue tolde me a fayr exa_m_ple therfore th[i]s day my sone shal not
dy. Tho sayd the master, Syr yf ye do so ye do wysely, [et] I thāke
you that ye haue spared your sone, this day for my wyll, and to god I
commende you.

_The Fourth Complaynte of the Empresse._


Whan thempresse herde that yᵉ chylde was not yet dede, she made grete
noyse [et] cryenges in such wyse that she was herde thrugh the palays
[et] sayd, Woo be to me that euer I was made Empresse, wolde god I had
dyed whan I was broughte in too thyse partyes. whan the emperour herde
yᵉ noyse [et] crye that she made, he entred in to the chamber, [et]
conforted her as moche as he myght [et] demaunded the cause of her
lamentacyon / whiche sayd, O myn owne lorde haue no wonder though that
I be in this grete sorowe and agony for I am your wyfe, [et] in your
company by your sone I am shamed as ye sawe me lately all be bled [et]
scratched. [et] ye haue promysed me that he sholde therfor be hanged /
[et] yet he lyueth. Wherfore sholde I not sorow. Themperour answered be
content [et] pleased / and I shall do iustyse vpon my sone to morowe.
But in that I forbare hym yesterday was at the meuyng of one of the
maysters by an example. Than sayd she, Haue ye forboren to do iustyce
for one worde, were it soo for all the worlde ye sholde not let to do
iustyce / [et] ye saye for the example of one mayster ye haue lefte
it. I fere me it shall happen with you [et] wᵗ youre maysters as vpon
a tyme it fortuned too an Emperoure with his seuen wyse maysters. The
empeperoure (_sic_) sayde I praye you tell me that example. She sayd.

To what entent sholde I laboure in vayne / for yesterdaye I shewed you
a good example and it auayled not. for whatsomeuer I shewe for youre
honoure and proufyte that the maysters of your sone torne vp and downe
to your destructyon, as in this present example I shall clerely shewe
you. To whome themperour sayd O my best beloued lady tell me that
example, that by the same I maye the better beware / for though that I
respyted my sones lyfe for one daye / I shal not therfore gyue hym his
lyfe / for that is dyfferred / it is not therfore auferred. And she
saide, gladly I shall shewe it for your proufyte. and began to tell it
as here after foloweth.

_The Fourthe Example of the Empresse._


Somtyme was in the cyte of rome seuen wyse maysters by whome all yᵉ
empyre was gouerned [et] ruled. And themperour that than was dyde no
thynge or attempte wᵗout the counseyll of them, as they vnderstode
that themperour was to them soo inclyned, yᵗ without theym he sholde
ordeyne or doo noo thynge. in yᵉ meane tyme they made by theyr arte
and connȳg yᵗ themperour sholde clerely se as longe as he was in his
palays but anone as he was out of his palays, he was made blynde /
[et] that dyde they to the ente_n_t yᵗ they myght the more frely
intromytte themself of all thynges that apperteyned to themperour, by
yᵉ whiche they gate [et] wanne too theym grete profyte [et] lucre of
goodes. [et] after that they had made [et] wroughte that experyment,
they coude neuer chaunge it ne fordo it, afterwarde, but themperour
abode styl blȳd many yeres. Then the vii maysters made [et] ordeyned
throughout thempyre, that yf ony man had dremed a dreme he sholde
come vnto them wᵗ a florene of golde or of syluer, [et] they sholde
expowne [et] declare vnto them the Interpretacyon of theyr dremes
wherby [et] by other vniuste meanes they obteyned moche more substaunce
[et] money of yᵉ people than themperour dyde. Soo vpon a tyme whan he
sate at the table wᵗ the empresse he began to syghe [et] sorowe in
hymselfe. and whan she perceyued that she enquyred dylygently of hym
yᵉ cause of his heuynesse [et] doloure. Themperour sayde / sholde not
that to me be heuy [et] sorowfull yᵗ I so longe haue been blynde [et]
out of my palays / [et] of yᵗ can haue or fynde no remedy. To whome
spake thempresse [et] sayd, my lorde here my counseyll [et] it shall
neuer repent you yf ye do therafter. In your courte ye haue vii wyse
maysters by whome ye [et] all yᵉ empyre is gouerned yf ye nowe beholde
[et] marke this in your mȳde / ye shall fynde that they are yᵉ cause
of your blyndnesse [et] dysease. [et] yf it be so they are worthy too
dye a shamefull deth. Therfore take hede to my coūseyl and aduyse.
Sende ye for them [et] shewe vnto them youre dysease [et] infyrmyte,
[et] threte them on payne of theyr lyues, yᵗ they sholde fynde a remedy
to make you hole of your syknesse [et] blyndnes. This coūseyl pleased
the emperour well. [et] anone sent for yᵉ maysters And whā they were
come, themperour anone shewed vnto the_m_ his infyrmyte [et] blyndenes.
[et] charge them vpon payne [of] deth / yᵗ they sholde seke a rememedy
(_sic_) [et] make hym hole therof. Tho answered they, Ye desyre of
vs a thi_n_ge that is dyffusyfe [et] harde for vs to do thus shortly
but gyue vs respyte [et] dayes [et] in yᵉ tenth day we shall gyue you
answere. Themperour was therwith well content [et] pleased. Then yᵉ
seuen wyse maysters went to counseyll, how they myght yᵗ best chaunge
[et] alter / [et] that in noo maner coude they fynde yᵉ meane howe they
myght put awaye yᵉ blyndnes from the Emperour. Wherfore they were all
ryght sorowfull. [et] sayde amonge them self, wᵗoute we fynde a remedye
we are all but dede men. Soo went they from thens thrugh out al thēpyre
[et] sought yf they coude fynde ony remedy or coūseyll therfore. It
hapned them vpon a tyme goynge thrugh a cyte, [et] in yᵉ myddes therof
they founde chyldren playnge. [et] a[f]ter them came a man wᵗ a talente
or florene of golde [et] sayd to them, Good maysters this nyght I haue
dremed a dreme, thenterpretacyon therof I wolde fayne knowe. Wherfore
I pray you shewe me what it sygnyfyeth [et] take this golde to you.
That herde one of yᵉ chyldren yᵗ played amonge yᵉ other [et] sayd too
hy_m_, gyue me yᵉ golde [et] not them, [et] I shall expowne thy dreme.
The man sayde, I dremed this nyghte yᵗ in the myddes of myn orchyerde
was a grete sprynge of water, wherof came many smal spry_n_ges yᵗ al
myn orchyerde was full [et] overflowen wᵗ water. The chylde sayd, take
a spade [et] dygge in yᵉ same place there as ye thought that yᵉ water
outsprange, [et] there shall ye fynde an horde of golde so grete that
ye [et] all your chylderne & lynage shall be for euer ryche. The man
dyde as yᵉ chylde had shewed hym [et] found ye tresoure accordynge to
hys wordes. Tho went yᵉ ma_n_ to yᵉ chylde [et] offred hym a pounde
weyght of yᵉ golde yᵗ he had founde for yᵉ interpretacyon of his dreme
[et] he wold none receyue but cōmytted hym to yᵉ prayers of yᵉ man.
The vii. maysters whan they herde yᵉ chylde so wysely expowne yᵉ
dreme, they sayd to hym, gode chylde what is your name he answered [et]
sayde I called Merlyne. Then sayd yᵉ maysters, we se clerely grete
wysedome in you, we shal shewe vnto you a grete mater, [et] of yᵗ we
wolde gladly yᵗ ye coude fynde a remedy. The chylde sayd, shewe me
your mater. And they sayd themperour of rome as longe as he is in his
palays he hath his syght clere wᵗout ony impedymēt and as sone as he
is gone out of his palays he is soo blȳde yᵗ he may not se. Yf ye can
now det_er_myne yᵉ cause herof [et] fy_n_de a remedy yᵗ he may be eased
[et] haue h[i]s syght ayen ye shall haue grete rewardes [et] honoures
of thēperour. The chylde sayd, I know yᵉ cause as wel of his blȳdhede
as of yᵉ remedy. They sayd to hy_m_, Come wᵗ vs to themperour [et] ye
shal be rewarded so largely yᵗ ye shall be pleased. To whome yᵉ chylde
sayd, I am redy to go wᵗ you. And whan they came wᵗ yᵉ chylde before
themperour they sayd to hy_m_. Lorde loo here this childe yᵗ we haue
brought afore you yᵉ which shal fulfyll your desyre as touchȳge the
cause of your blȳdenes as yᵉ recouerȳge of your syghte. Themperour
sayd, Good maysters woll ye take it vpon you [et] abyde therby that
yᵉ chylde shall do wᵗ me. They all sayd ye, for we be experte in his
wysedome. Themperour torned hymself towardes yᵉ chylde and sayde, wyll
ye vndertake to tell me the cause of my blindnesse [et] the remedye.
The chylde answered [et] sayd, my lorde the emperour lede me in to
your bedchamber, [et] there I shal shewe you what is to be done And as
he was therin broughte he sayd to yᵉ seruaūtes, take of yᵉ clothes of
the bedde, [et] all thapparayle, [et] ye shall se wonders. And as yᵗ
was done they sawe a well smokyng yᵗ had vii sprȳges or floodes, the
whiche whan thēperour sawe meruayled gretly. yᵉ chyld sayd ye se this
wel [et] wᵗout it be quēched ye shal neuer haue your sygt. thēperour
sayd, how may yᵗ be. yᵉ chyld sayd, but by one way. Themperour sayde,
Shewe vs than the meane, [et] yf it be possyble to me it shall be done,
yᵗ I maye recouer ayen my syght as well wᵗout as wᵗin. To whome the
chylde sayd my lorde yᵉ vii. sprynges of this well are thyse vii. wyse
maysters, yᵉ whiche you [et] your Empyre hythertoo haue trayterously
gouerned [et] haue you made blȳde as ye be wᵗoute your palays yᵗ they
youre subgettes by extorcyon myght plucke [et] pyll, ye not seynge, but
nowe they knowe not yᵉ remedy. Here ye nowe my counseyll. [et] this
well shal be quenched [et] extyncte. do stryke of yᵉ fyrste maysters
hede [et] anone ye shall yᵉ fyrste sprynge quenched. [et] so by ordre
one after an other, tyll yᵗ they are all beheded, [et] anone all the
sprynges wᵗ the well shall be vanysshed and gone awaye / [et] ye
shall haue ayen your syght as ye had afore. And as this was done [et]
fulfylled / the well with the vii. sprynges were vanysshed. And as
themperour had his syghte ayen he made the chylde a grete lorde [et]
gaue hy_m_ grete habundaūce of goodes. After that spake thempresse,
my lorde haue ye this example well perceyued that I haue tolde you.
[et] he sayd ye in the best wyse. ye haue recyted a good and a ryall
example. Than sayd she, In the same wyse your vii. wyse maysters
intende too doo with you, by theyre false narracyons, that your sone
may reygne vpon you / that god forbede.




 _The Declaratyon of the Example._


This welle is youre sone wherof oute flowen seuen sprynges, that
sygnefye the seuen wyse maysters the whiche soone ye maye not destroye
withoute the vii. maysters be made feble [et] broughte too noughte
that done this well that is your sone wᵗ all his cauyllacyons [et]
wyles shal not scape / but lete hym be hanged fyrste leste that he
haue helpe of his maysters / [et] forth after co[n]sequently yᵉ vii.
maysters. And so ye shall gouerne [et] guyde your empyre in reste [et]
peas. Themperour anone cōmaunded his seruauntes to lede his so_n_ to
the galowes / whiche they were lothe to do. So was there than a grete
multytude of people gadred with grete noyse [et] bewaylynge so that the
noyse came to yᵉ eres of yᵉ fourth mayster named Malquydrac. yᵉ whiche
lepte vpon his hors / [et] hasted hym to yᵉ palays. So mette wᵗ hym
his dyscyple [et] dyde reuerence to hy_m_ / [et] recommaunded hym vnto
hym / [et] whan he came before themperour [et] had done his obeysaunce
[et] reuere_n_ce as apperteyned. Themperour answered [et] sayde. Lytell
thanke haue ye olde cursed caytyfe for yᵉ techȳge of my sone for I
delyuered you my sone well spekȳge [et] in all thynge ryght vertuous.
And ye haue sent hym a fole dompe / [et] a rybaude / for he wolde haue
belayne wᵗ force my wyfe / [et] therfore all ye with him togyder shall
be hanged. Tho sayd yᵉ mayster, My lorde I haue not that deserued of
you. god knoweth why your sone speketh not. in shorte tyme ye shal
perceyue other thȳges. but yᵉ tyme is not yet comen. But in yᵗ ye say
he wolde haue oppressed your wyfe, yᵗ is not gospel ne proued, ne for
one sy_n_guler p[er]sone ye shold not iuge to deth your sone. yf now
for yᵉ wordes of your wyfe ye iuge your sone to dye, it wil be wors to
you than to an olde man of his wyfe. [et] that I shall proue. Too whome
themperour sayd, Thynke ye to doo with me ye olde dotarde, as somtyme
seuen wyse men dyde to an emperour. Therto sayd yᵉ mayster The offence
or trespace of one or yet of twenty, may not founde to the rebuke
[et] blame of all other, for ouer al the worlde there bee bothe good
[et] euyll. But one thynge of a trouth I shall shewe you. that euyll
shall come to you yf ye this daye do your sone to deth for the wordes
of your wyfe. the whiche I wolde shewe by a notable example. Than
sayd the emperoure woll ye that recyte for our lernynge. The mayster
sayde, Yf ye wyll calle ayen your sone, [et] kepe hym tyll I haue made
recytacyon of the example. [et] than what someuer ye shal thi_n_ke best
to done with hym, doo it. I shall reherce this example or elles not.
The emperour cōmaunded that he sholde be called ayen and desyred the
mayster to say as here after ensueth or foloweth.

 _The Example of the Fourthe Mayster._


There was an olde knyght [et] a ryght wyse ma_n_ that longe lyued
without wyfe [et] chylde. His frendes came to hym many tymes [et]
counseyled and exhorted him that he sholde take a wyfe. The knyght thus
counseyled [et] styred by his frendes soo oftymes that at the laste he
agreed too theym. And they gaue hym to wyfe the doughter of the prouost
of rome that ryche was [et] ryght fayre, whome whan he had seene anone
he was made blynde [et] taken in her loue, [et] began to loue her
meruaylously wel and whan they had ben a certayne space togyder [et]
had no fruyte ne chylde. Upon a tyme in a mornynge it happened that
she went to the chyrche where she met wᵗ her moder, [et] saluted her
as it behoued. My dere doughter sayd the moder how pleaseth you your
maryage [et] your husbonde: she sayd ryght euyll, for ye haue gyuen to
me an olde lame man / me in al thȳges dyspleasynge. I wolde ye had that
same tyme buryed me, for I had leuer lye [et] ete with a swyne than
with hym, and therfore I may no longer thus endure, but I must loue
another. Tho sayd yᵉ moder, god forbede that My dere doughter howe
longe tyme I haue be with your fader [et] yet hytherto I neuer medled
me with suche folysshenes. The doughter sayde, moder it is noo meruayle
for ye bothe in your youth met togyder, [et] the one toke solace of the
other, [et] I may receyue of hym noo maner of solace corporall for he
is colde / [et] vpon yᵉ bed he lyeth as styll as a stone, or as a thyng
immouable: The moder answered, yf ye wyll loue another say me what he
is. The doughter sayd a preest I wyl loue. to whome yᵉ moder sayd it
were better to you [et] lesse syn to loue a knyght or a squyer than a
preest. [et] the doughter sayde, If I shold loue a knyght or a gentel
squyer in shorte tyme he wolde be wery of me, [et] after yᵗ he wolde
do me shame [et] tell it ouer all, [et] so it is not of the preest,
for he wyll holde and kepe his owne honoure [et] counseyll as well
as mȳn, And also spyrytuell men be more true to theyr loues than the
seculer men. The mod_er_ sayd, Here my counseyll [et] it shall be good
for you. Olde folkes are wylly [et] fell, tempte your husbonde fyrst
[et] yf ye scape hym wᵗout doynge ony harme or smytȳge, than loue the
preest. The dought_er_ sayd I maye not so longe abyde. The moder sayd
vpon my blessynge abyde tyll ye haue proued hym. The doughter sayde
vpon your blessynge I wyll abyde so longe, tyll I haue attempted hy_m_
but fyrst say me how that I shal proue hym. The moder sayde, He hath in
his orchyerde a tree whiche he loueth moche. do yᵗ to be smyten downe
whyles he is oute at hontynge. [et] ayenst his comynge make hym there
a fyre, [et] yf he forgyue it you thā maye surely loue the preest. As
she had herde the coūseyl of her moder she went to her house. To whom
her husbonde sayd, Where haue ye ben so longe. She answered I haue ben
in the chyrche where as I met wᵗ my moder [et] wᵗ her a lytell I haue
talked [et] comyned, [et] so began proprely for to dyssymyle. After
mydday yᵉ knighte rode out for to hu_n_te. Then she thynkȳge vpon yᵉ
counseyll of her moder went to the gardyner [et] sayde to hy_m_. Cut
downe this yonge tree newly planted that I may make a fyre therof to
warme my lorde withal at his comynge from huntȳge, for it is a grete
wynd [et] a ryght sharpe colde. The gardyner sayde, Madame yᵗ wyll
I not do, for my lorde loueth better that tre than he dothe all yᵉ
other trees neuertheles I shal wel helpe you to gadre wood ynough
for to make withall a good fyre but in onywyse this I wyl not hewe
downe. She herde that, [et] boldly she toke yᵉ axe from yᵉ gardyner
[et] hewed downe the tree her selfe [et] made yᵉ gardyner wᵗ other to
bere it home. At euyn whan yᵉ lorde came from huntynge he was sore a
colde The lady lete make a grete fyre, [et] went [et] met wᵗ hym, [et]
set hym on a stole afore the fyre to warme. And as he a lytell whyle
had sytten he perceyued yᵉ odoure of the fyre. [et] called to hym yᵉ
gardyner [et] sayd, I fele by this odour yᵗ my newe plante brenneth
in the fyre. The gardiner sayde, Lorde it is trewe, my lady your wyfe
hath felled it down. The knyght sayd to her god forbede that my plante
sholde be cut downe by you. She answered anone [et] sayd, Lorde I haue
done it knowyng the weder colde [et] you also colde. [et] therfore I
haue ordeyned this fyre for your cōforte. As the knyght yᵗ herde he
loked angrely vpon her [et] sayd, O cursed woman, how werest yᵘ so
hardy to hewe downe so gentyl a yonge tre yᵉ whiche yᵘ knowest wel yᵗ
I loued aboue al other trees As she that herde she began to wepe [et]
excuse her selfe [et] sayd My lorde I haue done it for your good [et]
prouffyte, [et] ye take it so greuously. [et] began to cry wo wo be
to me. Anone as yᵉ knyght sawe ye wepȳge [et] teeres of his wyfe [et]
herde her cause he was meued wᵗ mercy saynge to her, Cesse of your
wepȳg, [et] beware how yᵗ ye ony more angre or trouble me in ony thȳge
/ that I loue. The next daye erly in the mornȳge / she went ayen to
the chyrchewarde, [et] met wᵗ her moder comȳge ayenst her. [et] they
salued eche other. Than yᵉ doughter sayd to her moder, O dere moder I
wyll loue the preest, for I haue attempted my lorde as ye coūseyled
me / but all for nought, for he anone forgaue it whan he sawe me a
lytell wepe. Tho sayd yᵉ moder, though olde men one tyme forgyue / they
double the payn vpon an other tyme. [et] therfore I counseyll you yᵗ
ye an other tyme attempte hym. Tho sayde the doughter I maye no lenger
abyde, for I suffer so moche payn for the loue of yᵉ preest, that wᵗ
my tonge I canne not tell, therfore ye shall perdone me I wyll noo
more folowe or do after your counseyll. than sayde the moder, for the
loue that the chylde sholde haue vnto the moder attempte hym yet ones.
[et] for your faders blessynge / and thenne yf ye goo quyte wᵗout ony
harme or betinge, loue the preest in the name of god. tho answered yᵉ
doughter, it is to me a grete payn so long tyme to abyde. neuertheles
for yᵉ blessyng of my fader I shal ons atēpte hym. but say me how I
shall begyn. the moder sayd I vnderstande yᵗ he hath a lytell hoūde yᵗ
he loueth wel [et] yᵗ kepith his bed. cast yᵉ hoūd wᵗ so grete might
afore his face that it dy [et] yf ye scape wᵗout a strype or that he
forgyue it lyghtely, in the name of god than loue the preest. Than sayd
the doughter, I shall in all thynge doo after your coūseyll, for there
is noo doughter lyuynge to day yᵗ wolde more gladly haue yᵉ blessynge
of the fader [et] the moder than I. And so she bad her moder fare well
/ [et] went to her house ayen / [et] that day wᵗ grete importunyte [et]
trouble of herte she brought too the nyght. [et] whan the nyghte was
comen, she cōmaunded the bed to be couered wᵗ pupure [et] wᵗ clothe
of golde the whyles the knyght sate by the fyre. And whan the bed was
thus made redy. the lytell hounde as he was accustomed lepte on the
bedde [et] she toke hym by the hynder legges, [et] wᵗ a wood [et] a
malycyous herte she cast it ayenst the wall yᵗ it lay styll dede. Whan
the good olde knyght that sawe / he was merueylously angry. [et] sayd
wᵗ a loude voyce too his wyfe, O worste [et] most cruell of all wycked
wymmen how coudest yᵘ fynde in thyn herte that lytell gentyll hounde
to sle, yᵗ I so moche loued. Lorde sayd she haue ye not sene how the
hounde wᵗ his foule fete hath our bed that is soo precyously couered
with ryche clothes made foule comynge out of the myre: And the knyghte
sayde wᵗ moche anger, knewe ye not yᵗ I loued moche better that lytell
hounde than the bed. Whan she herde that, anone she began pytyously
to wepe [et] sayd woo be to me that I was borne for all thynge that I
doo for the best it is all tourned in to the worste. The knyght wolde
not suffre the wepynge and weymentynge of his wyfe. but for that yᵗ
he loued her soo moche he sayd to her leue or cesse your wepȳge for
I forgyue you it all togyder. And I counseyll you that ye beware how
that ye dysplease me from hens forth / [et] they went toogyder to bed.
Upon yᵉ morowe she rose vp erly [et] went to the chyrche where as she
found her moder / to whome whan she hadde done reuerence as it behoued,
She sayd, moder now wyll I loue yᵉ preste, for I haue now attempted
the seconde tyme my husbonde [et] all thynges he suffred. The moder
sayde, O my dere doughter there is noo cruelte or falshede aboue the
cruelte of olde folkes. [et] therfore I coūseyll you yᵗ ye yet ones
proue hym. To whom the doughter answered, Moder ye laboure in vayne.
for yf ye wyst what [et] how moche payne yᵗ I suffer for yᵉ prestes
loue ye sholde rather helpe me yf ye loued me. The moder sayd, Here me
doughter this one tyme, [et] I shal neuer let you more. Thȳke howe yᵗ
ye haue souked mylke of my brestes: [et] the grete payne that I suffred
for you at your byrth. By thyse paynes my dere doughter I desyre of
[et] I charge you yᵗ ye denye me not this good petycyon. [et] I promyse
to god I shall no more let nor hȳder you of your entente: but rather
helpe you therto. / Tho answered yᵉ doughter, it is to me a grete
payne to absteyne me [et] forbere my selfe, so longe from the loue of
the preest. neuerthelesse for yᵉ grete charges that ye haue layde too
me, and also for yᵗ ye haue made a vowe no more for to lette me, but
to further me, tell me how I shall attempte hy_m_, [et] I shal ones
yet put it in aduenture. The moder sayd, I know well that on sondaye
next comyng he entendeth to haue vs all to dyner [et] there shall be
your fader [et] I and all your frendes [et] al yᵉ best of the cyte.
And whan ye are set in your place [et] all the metes are brought [et]
serued vpon the table / faste one of the keyes preuely yᵗ hangeth at
your gyrdell in the table clothe [et] than fayne to haue forgoten your
knyfe and say thyse wordes openly. Se what a shorte wytte that I am
of, I haue forgoten my knyf in my chambre / [et] ryse vp hastely [et]
go. [et] yᵉ cloth wᵗ al the metes ye shall caste down [et] ouerthrowe
vpon the grounde. And yf ye scape wᵗout payn I make a vowe to god I
shall neuer let you after. The doughter sayde yᵗ shall I gladly doo
[et] so toke her leue [et] departyd. The feste daye came yᵗ all as the
moder sayd were boden. The seruaūtes made redy [et] couered yᵉ table.
All were set at yᵉ table. [et] the doughter sate ouer ayenste her
lorde. And whan the table was well serued wᵗ metes [et] other thynges
as therto belonged / yᵉ lady of the house sayd with an high voyce, se
how forgeteful I am of mynd I haue lefte my knyfe in my chamber yᵉ
whiche I muste fetche / [et] rose hastely vp and drewe yᵉ clothe with
all the mete that was vpon it with her. a_n_d all the golde vessels
[et] saltes lay vpon yᵉ groūde. The knyght vexed sore angrye in his
herte, but for shame he dyssymyled afore his gestes, [et] cōmaūded
on other clene clothe [et] other metes to be brought [et] wᵗ Joy and
myrth he solyted [et] meued his gestes to ete and make good chere. so
that by hy_m_ they were all gladed. The feste or dyner done they gaue
all thankȳges to yᵉ knyght [et] toke theyr leue [et] departed euery man
towardes his owne house. Upon yᵉ nexte day in the mornȳge yᵉ knyghte
arose erly [et] went to the chyrche [et] herde a masse the which ended
went to a barbour [et] sayd too hym, Mayster are ye experte in blode
letynge in what vayne yᵗ I wyll desyre you. He sayde, syr I am experte
in what vayne yᵗ ye can name in mannes body. The knyghte sayd, I am
well contente come on wᵗ me. [et] whan he was comen to his house he
entred in to his chamber where his wyfe laye in bed [et] sayd to her
Ryse vp shortely. Than sayd she, what shall I do vp thus erly it is
not yet nyne the clocke. The knyght sayd, ye muste ryse vp, for ye
muste be letten blode on both your armes. she sayd, I was neuer laten
blode / [et] shall I nowe blede. Tho sayd yᵉ knyght, that is trouth,
[et] therfor ye are a fole. For thȳke ye not yᵗ ye hewe fyrst downe my
tree, [et] an other tyme ye kylled my lytell hoūde [et] yesterday ye
shamed me afore all our frendes [et] parentes. [et] the fourth is yf
I sholde suffer you thus too go forthe ye sholde me for euer confoūde
[et] shame. the cause herof I consyder yᵗ ye haue euyll [et] wylde
blode wᵗin your body, [et] therfore I wyll that yᵗ corrupte blode shall
be drawen out that ye from hensforth shal no more put me to shame [et]
angre, and lete to be made a grete fyre. and she stode and cryed and
helde vp her hondes towardes the heuen and sayde, My lorde forgyue me
this t[r]espace[2] / and haue pyte vpon me at this tyme, and I shal
neuer more offende you. The knyghte sayd pray for no mercy, for by
the mercy that god hath wroughte, without that thou holdest oute thyn
arme strayte I shall sone haue thyn herte blood. and he sayd also to
the barbour, smyte harde [et] make a depe hole in her arme, or elles
I shall gyue you a grete strype. Than smote yᵉ barbour so sore that
the bloode came habundaūtly out. and the knyght wolde not suffer hym
to staunche it vnto the tyme that she chaunged coloure in her vysage.
And as this was done the knyght had to be stopped or staūche yᵗ vayne.
[et] bad yᵉ barbour smyte the vayne vpon yᵉ other arme. Then̄e cryed
she wᵗ a loude voyce, My swete husbonde haue compassyon vpon me for now
I deye. The knyght answered, my wyfe ye sholde haue afore thought on
th[i]s or that ye haue done to me thyse thre euyll tournes or despytes.
Then̄e she helde out her left arme. [et] yᵉ barbour smote therin an
hole yᵗ the blood came out ryght hudgely. [et] suffred her to blede
vnto the tyme that the coloure in her vysage chaunged [et] that she
swouned / Than sayd the knyght, now bynde that arme [et] staūche it.
[et] sayd to her now goo to bed, [et] studye and thynke hensforth how
ye may amende your self or elles I shall draw yᵉ bloode of your herte.
And as this was done he gaue the barbour his rewarde and he wente ayen
vnto his own house. and the wyfe vnder yᵉ handes of hir maydens nyghe
deed was ladde to hyr bedde [et] bad one of hir handmaydens go to hyr
moder in all haste [et] say that she come speke with me afore I deye.
The moder whan she harde yᵗ she was gladde of yᵉ correctyon of hir
doughter [et] hastely came to hyr / the doughter whȳ she herd hyr moder
sayd to hir, O my moste swete moder I am almoste dede, for I haue so
moche blode bled, yᵗ I byleue yᵗ I shal not scape yᵉ deth. Tho answered
yᵉ moder / sayd I not too you that olde men are ryght cruell [et] fell,
wyll ye nowe loue the preste. Whiche sayd, The deuyll may the preest
confounde [et] shame. I wyl neuer loue other but my husbonde. Than
sayde the mayster to themperour, Lorde haue ye vnderstande me. And he
answered ryght well, for amonges all other yᵗ euer I haue herde this
was the best example. Thre euyll dedes she dyde vnto her husbonde [et]
I doute not but yf she had done yᵉ fourth she sholde haue shamed hym
for euer. Than sayd yᵉ mayster therfore I counseyll you yᵗ ye beware of
your wyfe leste that it happen worse to you. for why yf ye doo to deth
your onely sone for her wordes, ye shall be deceyued in yᵉ ende, [et]
for euer ye shal forthynke it. The Emperour sayd truly mayster this day
my sone shal not dye. The mayster sayd My lorde I thanke you yᵗ ye for
min example and my sake this day haue spared your sone.




_The Fyfth Complaynte of the Empresse._


The empresse herȳg yᵗ the chylde was not yet dede apparayled [et]
clothed her in her vesture or clothȳge. [et] lete to be ordeyned her
waynes [et] cartes / as thoughe she wolde haue gone to her fadʳ home
in her coūtre for to haue cōplayned of yᵉ grete shame yᵗ was done vnto
her [et] coude haue no remedy herof. The seruaūtes seynge yᵗ went [et]
shewed it to themperour yᵗ thempresse was goyng in to her countree.
Whan he yᵗ perceyued he went to her saynge, whither are ye goynge, I
hoped yᵗ ye had loued me so moche yᵗ in all yᵉ worlde ye sholde haue
sought no solace but wᵗ me. To yᵗ she sayd, That is true. [et] therfore
I go from you, for I had leuer here of your deth, than to see you
dye, wᵗoute doute ye delyte soo moche to here thyse maysters, yᵗ it
shall happen vpon you as it dyde to Octauian themperour yᵉ whiche wes
so coueytous that ye noble men of the empyre buryed hym quycke [et]
fylled his mouth wᵗ molten golde. Themperour sayd, Dere wyf do not
that another tyme yᵉ blame to you or to me myght be layde. Than sayd
the empresse, truly yᵉ blame is yours for haue ye not promysed me many
tymes that your sone sholde dye, [et] yet he lyueth, [et] therfore from
hensforth I wyll no more byleue you. Then sayd themperour. It becometh
not a kynge euery cause lyghtly too dyscusse, wᵗout aduyse [et]
specyally vpon his sone, vpon whome it is not behoueful lyghtly to gyue
jugement and therfore I say [et] pray you that ye wyll tell me somwhat
by the whiche I may myselfe gouerne, for it is vtter destruccōn of a
kynge wᵗout aduyse [et] vndescretly to gyue jugement. She answered [et]
sayde, I wyll gladly tell you a notable example, so that from hensforth
ye shall not be coueytous or desyrous to here yᵉ maysters. And began to
saye in this forme.

_The Fyfth Example of the Empresse._


Octauianus themperour reygned in Rome ryghte ryche [et] coueytous.
[et] aboue all thynges he loued golde. The cytezyens yᵗ tyme of Rome
dyde moche harme [et] many grete outrages to other nacyons. In soo
moche that dyuerse nacyons [et] regyons were meued [et] styred ayenst
yᵉ Romayns. In that tyme there was mayster Uirgilius, yᵉ whiche
excelled in magique [et] in other scyences all other maysters. The
cytezeyens prayed hym that he by his arte [et] connȳge wolde make
somwhat by the whiche they of theyr ennemyes myght haue warny_n_g
[et] knowlege byfore. Wherby that they myght puruey for themselfe yᵉ
better. He lete doo make by his arte and connȳge a toure, [et] aboue
vpon yᵉ toure dyde to be set as many ymages as in al the worlde were
regyons and prouy_n_ces. and in the myddes of the toure he let to be
made and set an ymage, whiche helde in his hande an appell or a grete
roūde balle of golde. And euery ymage of the toure helde in his hand
a lytell bell, and stode torned lokynge towardes his owne prouynce
to hym assygned. And as oftentymes as ony prouynce wolde styre or
rebel ayēste the romaynes, so often torned hym the ymage of yᵗ londe
[et] range the bell. That herȳge the cytezeyns of Rome armed themselfe
[et] to that prouynce yede with all theyr myght for that londe to
kepe vnder. And soo was there no londe so grete yᵗ coude wreke them
vpo_n_ the romaynes, and therfore were they bedradde and fered ouer all
the worlde. After that Mayster Uirgilius[3] made for the solace and
conforte of the poor people a lyght that alwaye brende, and by that
lyghte he made two bathes, the one of them hote, in the whiche the
poore people myghte bathe and wasshe theym / [et] that other colde in
the whiche they myghte theymselfe refresshe, and betwyx that lyghte and
the bathes he made an ymage standynge, in whos forhede was wryten: He
yᵗ smyteth me shall anone haue vengeaunce. This ymage stode there many
yeres. At the laste there came a clerke and behelde that ymage [et]
radde this wrytynge / and thoughte in hymselfe, what vengeaūce myght he
fynde therfore. I byleue better that yf ony man sholde smyte the that
thou fyllest there wᵗ to yᵉ erthe, he sholde fynde some tresoure vnder
thy sete. [et] therfore is thy wrytynge that no man sholde haue it.
[et] the clerke lyfte vp hys hande [et] gaue the ymage a grete stroke
yᵗ it fell to yᵉ grou_n_de. [et] anone yᵉ lyght was out. [et] the
bathes were vanysshed away, [et] he foūde no tresoure. The poore folke
yᵗ perceyuynge were all sorowfull sayenge, cursyd mote he be for euer
more yᵗ for his synguler coueytyse hathe destroyed this ymage. [et] vs
hathe robbed of so grete solace [et] cōforthe. Here after assembled
thre kynges the whiche of yᵉ Romayns had been oppressed [et] suffred
greate wronges. [et] went to coūysell wᵗ them of theyr coūysell, how
they myght best of yᵉ Romayns be auenged. [et] some of the_m_ sayd.
we labour in vayne, as longe as there standyth yᵉ tour wᵗ the ymages
we maye no thynge do ayenste theym. To yᵗ counseylle arose vp foure
knyghtes and sayd to the kynges, we haue thoughte a goode remedy how we
shal destroye the toure wᵗ the ymages and yᵗ to do and brynge aboute we
wyll our lyues sette to pledge. Yf that ye wyll do yᵉ coste. Tho sayd
yᵉ kynges what coste shall we do. They sayd, we must haue iiii tonnes
full of golde. Than sayd yᵉ kynges, take that golde [et] fulfyll youre
promyse. The knyghtes toke yᵉ golde [et] went towardes Rome. [et] whan
they were thyder come in the nyght wᵗout one of yᵉ yates in the dyche
wᵗ water they drowned one of yᵉ tonnes wᵗ the golde. [et] another tonne
they drowned by the secōde yate [et] the thyrde tonne by yᵉ thyrde
yate. [et] the fourth ton̄ by the fourth yate they drowned. And whan
they had thus done erly in the mornynge they entred in to yᵉ cyte at
an houre conuenyent whan yᵗ themperour went ouer the marte, they dyde
to hym reuerence as it behoued. Themperour seynge them demaunded frome
whens they were, or what scyences or what seruyce yᵗ they coude do.
Whiche answered, we are of ferre cou_n_trees [et] we be sothsayers so
perfyte yᵗ there was neuer thynge so preuely or secretly hydde but yᵗ
we shall fȳde it by our dremes. We haue herde that ye laboure [et] haue
pleasure in such thynges, and therfore came we to you for to wyte yf ye
had ony nede of our seruyce / Themperour sayd, I shall proue you [et]
yf it be so yᵗ I fynde you true, ye shall haue of me grete rewardes
[et] thanke. they sayde we aske no thynge but yᵉ haluen dele for our
rewarde of the golde that by vs shall be foūden. The emperour sayd,
I am therwith wel content. And thus had they with the emperour many
wordes. At euen whan themperour was goyng to bedde they sayde too hym.
My lorde yf it please you this nyghte shall the oldest of vs set his
connynge a werke [et] dreme, [et] the thyrde day we shall shewe you his
dreme [et] what it sygnefyeth. Themperour sayd goo in goddis name. And
they went forth wᵗ grete gladnesse. [et] all yᵗ nyght they passed ouer
with derysions [et] myrth vpon truste that they sholde come to a good
purpose. whan yᵉ thyrde daye was comen they went erly too themperour.
[et] the fyrste of them sayd my lorde pleaseth you to goo with vs
without one of yᵉ yates of thy cyte [et] I shall shewe you where as a
tonne full of golde is hyd. Themperour sayd, I shall go with you and
se yf it be true that ye saye. whan they were comen to the place they
drewe out yᵉ tonne that they there afore had put / The emperour whan
he that sawe was gladde, and gaue to them theyr parte. Tho sayde the
seconde dremer, my lorde this nyght I shal dreme. Themperour sayd, god
gyue you a good dreme. yᵉ next nyght came he [et] toke out yᵉ other
tonne, and gaue it to themperoure, [et] toke hym his dele. In lyke wyse
dyd the thyrde. [et] yᵉ fourth, vpon yᵉ whiche themperour was out of
all mesure ioyus [et] glad [et] sayd he had not sene afore soo true
[et] experte sothsayers or dremers as they were / Than sayd they al
togyder at once as it had ben out of one mouth, my lorde we haue one
after another dre_med_ yᵉ whiche as ye haue sene be all true proued.
But now yf it please you that we may dreme all togyder this nyghte,
we truste that too vs shall bee shewed where we shall fynde a greate
quantyte or substaūce of golde [et] of rychesse. the Emperoure sayde
god gyue to you a gode dreme yᵗ to me and to you may be proffytable.
Unto yᵉ next morowe they came ayen vnto yᵉ Emperoure [et] sayd to hym
wᵗ joyouse [et] gladde vysages or coūtenaūces. My lorde we brynge gode
[et] proffytable tydynges, for this nyght in our slepes such [et] so
grete a tresour is to vs shewed yᵉ whiche yf ye wyll suffre it for to
be soughte, ye shall be so moche enryched that in this worlde shall
be none to you lyke. Themperour sayd, where sholde yᵉ fynde ye hoorde
or tresoure. they sayd, vnder the fundament of the tour yᵗ the ymages
standen on. The Emperoure answered, God defend that I sholde for
loue of golde destroye that toure wᵗ ymages wherwith yᵗ we of oure
ennemyes be defended [et] warned. They sayde too hym ayen, My lorde,
Haue ye founde vs in our saynges otherwyse than true [et] ryghtful.
Themperour sayd nay. O Lorde sayd they, we with our owne hondes shall
gete oute yᵉ gold wᵗout hurtynge of the tour or of yᵉ ymages. And it
is expedyent yᵗ secretly in the nyght by vs it be done, for drede of
resorte and concours of yᵉ people leste that ye sholde ren in the noyse
[et] clamour of theym, and also that they sholde not take that good
and golde away from you and vs. The Emperour sayde, Goo in the name of
god and doo your beste, as ye well can̄e, and I shall to morowe erly
come too you. Tho went they with joye and gladnesse, and in the nyght
they were laten in too the toure, and with grete haste and dylygence
they vndermynded it. [et] on the next daye erly they mounted vpon theyr
horses [et] rode ayen towardes theyr owne countre with ioye [et] glory.
And or that they came wᵗout the syght of rome / the toure fell downe.
And on the morne ensuynge whan it was fallen / [et] the Senatours it
perceyued they sorowed gretely [et] there was a grete sorowe [et]
bewaylynge thrughout all yᵉ cyte [et] went to themperour [et] sayd,
lorde how maye it be yᵗ this tour is thus fallen, by the whiche we haue
alwayes had warnynge afore of our enemyes. He answered [et] sayd, To me
came foure fals deceyuers [et] fayned themself to be foure sothsayers
[et] yᵗ they coude fynde tresoure hyd in the groūde. And they sayd
that vndʳ the fundacyon of yᵉ toure was hydde an vnnumerable sōme of
golde yᵉ whiche they sholde well vndermyne wᵗout hurtȳge of the toure
or ymages / [et] I gaue fayth to them [et] they haue deceyued me.
they answered hy_m_ / ye haue coueyted so moche golde, [et] for your
insacyate couetyse we shall be all destroyed. but fyrste your couetyse
shall full (_sic_) vpon your selfe. [et] toke [et] ladde hym vnto
yᵉ capytoll, [et] layde hym on his bac [et] poured his mouth full of
molten golde, sayng to hy_m_ ye haue desyred golde, [et] therfore ye
shall dry_n_ke golde [et] after they buryed hym quycke. Not long after
that came thenmyes ayenst ye Romayns, [et] ouercame [et] destroyed them
al. Than sayd thempresse vnto themperour haue ye my lorde this example
well vnderstand [et] he sayd ryght well. Than sayd she, The tour wᵗ
the ymages is your body wᵗ your v. wyttes, as long as ye lyue there
none so hardy to trouble or make werre vpon you ne vpon your people.
That hath your sone ryght well vnderstonde wᵗ his vii. maysters [et]
wᵗ theyre false narracyons or fables fynde how they may destroye you,
for ye are ouermoche couetyse to here [et] enclyned to them. [et] in
so moche yᵗ they shal vndermyne you [et] caste you vnd_e_r fote, [et]
brȳge you to nought. The ymages are your fyue wyttes yᵗ be all lost.
for they se yᵗ ye be all chyldyshe or folyshe they shall destroy and
sle you. [et] your sone shall opteyne your empyre. Thēperour sayd, ye
haue recyte to me a good exāple. wherfore it shall not to me happen as
it dyde wᵗ yᵉ tour but my sone fyrste this daye shall be hanged. To
whome thempresse sayd, yf ye doo so ye shall fare well [et] lyue long.
Upon yᵉ nexte day he commaūded hy_m_ to be lad to hangȳge. [et] as he
was towardes yᵉ galowes lad, came rydynge ayenst hym vpon an hors his
fyfth mayster towardes yᵉ palays. [et] came before themperour [et]
saluted hym wᵗ all reuerence / [et] he despysed his salutacyon. [et]
put hym in fere of his lyfe. [et] yᵉ mayster sayd My lorde I haue not
deserued to dye. [et] ye my salutacyon despyse it is not your honoure.
for your sone hath not with vs be of such condycyo_n_s as ye repute
hy_m_ for as ye in short tyme shal fynde. [et] that he speketh not is
of his his (_sic_) grete wysdome. [et] knowe ye yᵗ he shal well speke
as yᵉ tyme comyth, though yᵗ he now speke not, as ye in shorte tyme
shall here. But ye saye yᵗ he your wyfe wolde haue shamed. yᵗ byleue
not. for so wise a man as he is neuer sholde atte_m_te so shamful a
dede. And ye put hym to dethe for your wyues wordes, ye sholde not
scape without shame and vengeaunce / In lyke wise as Ypocras scaped not
wᵗout vengeaūce for yᵉ deth of Galtenus his cosyne. The emperour sayd
that wolde I fayne here and vnderstonde. The mayster sayd, what sholde
auayle yᵉ narracyon to tel vnto you for your prouffyte yf in the meane
seasone your sone sholde be hanged. [et] therfore yf ye wyll call ayen
your sone, and therafter do as ye thynke beste it shall be at your
pleasure. Themperour lete call ayen his sone and set him in pryson. And
tho began yᵉ mayster too tell vnder this maner as foloweth:

_The Example of the Fyfthe Mayster._


Somtyme there was a famous physycyan named Ypocras ryght connynge, yᵉ
which exceded all other in connynge [et] scye_n_ce he had wᵗ hym his
neuewe or kynnesman yᵗ was called Galienus, yᵉ whiche he loued moche.
This Galien_us_ was of an excellēt wytte [et] applyed all his wytte
[et] mynde to lerne of h[i]s vncle the scyence of physyke. Whan Ypocras
apperceyued that in as moche as he coude hyde from hym hys conynge
ferynge that he sholde excelle hym in yᵗ crafte, for yᵉ grete wytte
that he was of. As Galienus this sawe, he studyed [et] excersysed, in
soo moche yᵗ in shorte tyme he had perfyte connynge physyke. for the
whiche Ypocras enuyed hym moche. It hapned vpo_n_ a tyme therafter,
yᵗ the kȳge of Ungary sent his messengers vnto Ypocras that he sholde
come vnto hym his sone fer to cure or make hole. Ypocras excused
hȳself [et] wolde no goo. but sent his cosyne Galienus wᵗ his wrytynge
in the company of yᵉ messengers for to excuse hym. And whan Galienus
was comen afore yᵉ kynge he was ryghte worshypfully receyued. but
he merueyled why that Ypocras wolde not come. he excused hym saynge
that he had many grete thynges too do that he myght not come, but he
hath sent me in his stede. [et] wᵗ the helpe of god I shall make hole
that childe. That pleased well yᵉ kynge. Galienus went to the chylde.
[et] whan he had seene his vryne, and tasted his pounces. he sayd tho
(_sic_) the quene. O excellent prynces I pray you here [et] suffer
my wordes, [et] tel me who is yᵉ fadʳof this chylde. She sayd, who
sholde be his fader but my lorde the kyng. Galienus sayd, I am sure
yᵗ he is not the fader. She answered yf ye wyll say yᵗ for a trouth I
shall doo your hede to be smytn of. he answered I say yet ones agayn
yᵗ this ky_n_ge is not the fader and I am not therfore comen hyther
to lese my hede. for I haue no suche rewarde deserued. [et] he was
goynge his waye. The quene yᵗ seynge spake. O good mayster yf ye wyl
kepe it secrete, [et] not dyscouer me, I shal shewe [et] open vnto you
myn herte. The mayster sayd God defende that from me, that I to no
persone sholde shewe it. and therfore O noble quene shewe it boldely
to me for it shall neuer passe my mouthe after. and I shall your sone
ease and make hym hole. She sayde yf ye doo that, ye shall haue of me
a good rewarde. [et] therfore here what I shall saye. Of fortune came
hyther vnto my lorde, the kyng of Burgondyen, and he was so longe wᵗ
me conuersaunt that this chylde by hym I bare. Tho sayd yᵉ mayster,
fere ye not, I knewe well that it was so byfore. [et] anone he gaue
the chylde to ete beef or of an oxe to dry_n_ke. and the chylde was
eased of his infyrmyte. And whan as the kȳge herde that the chylde was
quite of his malady he gaue vnto yᵉ mayster a good rewarde. but of
the quene he secretly receyued and had a greter gyfte and a specyal
thanke and went his waye. And whan that he was comen home, Ypocras his
mayster demaunded of hym, haue ye yᵗ chyld heled. [et] he sayd ye. Than
asked he hy_m_ what he gaue to hym. [et] he sayd, I gaue hy_m_ fleshe
of ox beef to ete, [et] water to dry_n_ke. Tho sayd Ypocras. Than is
the moder of that chylde not true too her husbonde. yᵗ is trouth sayd
Galienus. Ypocras anone was meued wᵗ enuye, [et] thought in hymselfe yf
here be not found a remedy, my scyence shall no more be set by. [et]
he shal be named and praysed aboue me. And from that day forthwarde he
thought [et] deuysed how he myght slee hym. Uppon a day Ypocras called
and sayd come go we to seke and gadre herbes in the gardyne. To whome
he sayd mayster I am redy. And whan they were comen in to yᵉ gardyne,
Ypocras sayd, I fele that this herbe is ryght vertuous, stoupe downe
[et] gadre me of it. Galienus dyde so. and as they went aboute the
gardyne, sayd Ypocras now knowe I well by yᵉ odoure of this herbe that
it is better [et] precyoser than golde. and therfore stoupe downe to
the groūde [et] drawe hym oute wᵗ the rotes for he is ryght moche.
Galien_us_ bowed hymself down to plucke vp the herbe. Ypocras drewe out
his knyfe [et] kylled hym. After that Ypocras fyll seke to the dethe
that yᵉ strengthes of his body fayled hym and dyde as moche as he coude
to helpe hymself but it wold not be and as his scolers [et] dyscyples
herde of it they went hastely to hy_m_. [et] all that they myght or
coude do for the prouffyte of his helthe they dyde / but it auayled
hym nothynge. Whan Ypocras that perceyued, he sayd vntoo his scolers.
Goo and fetche me a grete tonne and fyll it full vnto the brynkes with
water. And whan they had soo done, he sayd too them make nowe therin
an hondred hooles, and whan that was doone, there wente none of the
water oute. Tho sayd Ypocras. Beholde my moste dere dyscyples, how
yᵗ yᵉ vengeaunce of god is fallen vpon me as ye openly may see, for
in this tonne are an hondred holes, [et] yet gooth there out not one
droppe, ryght so there cometh no vertue out of yᵉ herbes to helpe me.
and therfore what ye doo to me it helpeth not, for I must dye. But
my dere chyldren yf my neuewe Galienus were now on lyue, he sholde
hele me, whom I haue slayne / yᵗ me sore forthynketh. [et] therfore
yᵉ vengeaūce of god cometh ouer me. And this sayd he torned hy_m_ to
yᵉ wal [et] gaue vp the goost. Tho sayd yᵉ mayster to themperour,
My lorde vnderstande ye well what I haue sayd. He answered ye ryght
well, what hurte had it bē to hym [et] Galienus had lyued. The mayster
answerd it had ben ryght good, for Ypocras at that tyme had not dyed,
[et] therfore by yᵉ ryghtwyse Jugement of god his medycynes auayled
hy_m_ not. [et] therefore I shewe to you yᵗ it shall happen worse to
you, yf yᵗ ye put to deth your sone for yᵉ wordes of your wyfe, which
in tyme of necessyte shall assyste [et] socoure you. [et] consyder ye
not, yᵗ ye haue after your fyrst wyfe, ye haue wedded this wyfe yᵗ ye
now haue. [et] so ye may yᵉ thyrde [et] yᵉ fourthe, [et] neuer shall
ye haue of ony of them suche a sone yᵗ shal kepe [et] saue you from
peryll. Themperour sayde truly he shal not dye. Tho sayd yᵉ mayster
than do ye wysely, [et] I commende you to god, [et] thanke you, yᵗ ye
haue this daye for me spared your sone. Themperour sayd I marke this
wel yᵗ wy_m_me_n_ are crafty, [et] subtyl, herfore I wyl not for you
but for my self saue hy_m_.

_The Syxte Complaynte of the Empresse._


Whan that thempresse had knowledge, she shewed her selfe as a wode
or an Impacyent body yᵗ all that sawe her or herde her wondred [et]
sayd to themperour your wyfe she pyneth her self as though she sholde
deye. Themperour that heryng went to her [et] sayd wherfore be ye so
heuy, [et] so impacyent. O lorde how shold I holde it in, whan I am
the only doughter of a kyng [et] your wyfe, [et] in your company I
haue had a grete despyte [et] shame, and contynually ye haue promysed
me to punysshe it, but ye perfourme it not. The emperour sayd, I wote
not what I shal do. ye laboure from day to day to haue my sone slayne,
and the maysters labour to saue his lyfe. And amonges al thyse I know
well that he is my sone, but whether the trouth is that knowe I not.
Than sayd she, that is it yᵗ I complayne that ye beleue the maysters
more than ye do me. Therfore it shall happen to you as dyde to a kyng
with his stewarde. Than sayd the Emperoure, tell that example, happely
it sholde meue me the soner to put my sone to deth. She sayde, gladly,
but I praye you gyue attendaunce what I shall saye, and began to tel as
hereafter ensueth.

_The Syxte Example of the Empresse._


There was a kyng ryght proude [et] merueylously dyfformed in his vysage
in suche wyse that wȳmen hym hated [et] abhorred. This kynge thought
Rome to destroye [et] the romaynes to slee, [et] yᵉ bodyes of Peter
[et] Poule to take [et] cary awaye, whiche while he was in this my_n_de
he called to hy_m_ his stewarde that was ryght secrete wᵗ hym of his
pryue counseyll and sayd to hym. Seke me a fayre woman yᵗ this nyghte
may slepe wᵗ me. The stewarde answered, My lorde ye knowe wel your
infyrmyte [et] dysese, [et] yᵗ no woma_n_ wyll doo it wᵗout a grete
somme of money. The ky_n_ge sayd, thynke ye yᵗ for money I wyll want
one, haue I not golde [et] syluer ynough though it were a thousande
florenys I sholde it gladle gyue. The stewarde herynge yᵗ was anone
smyten wᵗ couetyse, went too his owne wyfe whiche was ryght fayre,
chast, [et] of a gode kynrede, [et] sayde to her, O my good wyfe, my
lorde desyreth [et] coueyteth fore to slepe wᵗ a fayr [et] beauteuouse
woman, [et] wyll not forbere it, though yᵗ she wold aske of hym a
thousande florenys, and hath commaunded me too puruey hym of one. And
therfore I counseyll you that ye to vs gete that money. The wyfe sayde,
were it not so that the kynge so proude and foule of vysage were, yet
wolde I not to that euyl consente bycause of the synne ayenst god. The
stewarde answered, [et] I consente that ye shal do it, [et] therto I
cou_n_seyl and cōmaunde you, and promyse you wᵗoute that ye co_n_sente
to me herin, ye shall neuer haue good daye wᵗ me. She heryng that
trembled, in so moche that for drede she consented to hym. The stewarde
yᵗ herynge went to the kynge [et] sayd Syr I haue founde a fayre woman
[et] she is comen of a good house, whiche wil not lesse haue than a
thousande florenes [et] in the euin she shall come, [et] erly in the
morny_n_g she must away that she be not seen of the people. The kynge
answered [et] sayd, I am well content. whan the nyght was comen the
stewarde lad his wyfe to yᵉ kynges bed and made faste the dore [et]
yede his waye. Erly in the morny_n_ge the stewarde arose [et] went vnto
yᵉ kynge [et] sayd. My lord it shall be daye wᵗin a whyle, it is good
that ye performe your promise [et] let the woman go. The kyng sayd this
woman pleseth me so well yᵗ so sone she shall not departe from me. whan
the stewarde that herde he departed thens al sory. unneth he taryed
ony whyle but came to the kynge and sayd. My lorde the mornynge is
comen, therfore let the woman goo, leste yᵗ she be ashamed, as I have
promysed her. The kyng sayd yet shall she not go from me. [et] therfore
goo out and shet the dore ayen. The stewarde ryght sorowfull departed
and wente vp [et] downe with an heuy [et] an angry herte, tyll that
the fayre [et] the clere daye appered, and than entred ayen in to the
chamber and sayd. My lorde it is clere daye, suffre that woman to
departe that she be not therwith ashamed. The kynge answered/ I saye to
you for a trouth she shall not yet departe for her co_m_pany is to me
ryght pleasau_n_t [et] acceptable. The stewarde yᵗ hery_n_ge coude no
lenger forbere ne holde his owne cou_n_seyll, but sayd vnto yᵉ kyng. O
my good and gracyous lorde I beseche you suffre her to departe for it
is myn owne wyfe. The kynge herynge that sayd to hym. Open yᵉ wyndowe.
[et] whan it was open, the fayre [et] and the bryght day appered. he
behelde the woman ryght fayre and goodly. perceyued yᵗ it was yᵉ wyfe
of the stewarde [et] sayd to hym. O thou moste [et] worste rybaude or
knaue, why haste thou for so lytell money ashamed [et] vndone thy good
[et] fayre wyfe. [et] her vnto me vnwetyngly haste delyuered. Therfore
haste yᵉ [et] gete the out of my realme [et] neuer more herafter come
in my syghte, for frome hensforth yf euer I may se the thou shalt dye
yᵉ moost shamefull [et] horryblest dethe that euer canne be ymagyned.
Whan yᵉ stewarde herde yᵗ he fled his waye [et] durste not abyde [et]
was neuer so hardy ony more to come in to that realme. And yᵉ ky_n_ge
kepte yᵉ wyfe al hys lyuedayes in grete worshyp, and gaue to hyr plente
of all thynges that to her behoued [et] appertayned. After that the
kynge lete do gadre [et] assemble a grete [et] a myghty armye [et]
puyssau_n_ce of men of werre. [et] went to Rome with grete myght, [et]
besyeged the cyte on all sydes, so long tyll that the Romayns wolde
haue delyuered hym for to haue departed and withdrawen hymself from
thens the bodyes of the holy apostles Petyr [et] Poule. Than was there
in yᵉ cyte seuen wyse maysters as ye nowe haue, by the cou_n_seyll of
whome all the cyte was gyded [et] gouerned. And the cytezeyns came too
theym and sayd. what shall we do, it behoueth vs as that we delyuere
vnto oure dedely ennemyes the bodyes of the holy apostles or elles
ye cyte. Tho answered yᵉ fyrste mayster. I shall wᵗ my wysdome [et]
connynge this day yᵉ cyte [et] yᵉ body of the apostles saue. [et] so
one after another promysed to doo yᵉ same, eueryche of theym for one
daye. In lyke wyse as yᵉ maysters haue promysed your sone. wᵗ that yᵉ
kynge began to assaute the cyte on all partyes. Tho began yᵉ fyrste
mayster to saye, [et] to alledge so wysely for to haue pease, yᵗ yᵉ
kynge that day lefte his assaute makynge [et] withdrewe hym a lytyll
fro the cyte. [et] soo dyde all the maysters one after an other vnto
the laste. To whome came yᵉ burgeyses [et] sayd. O mayster ye shall
vnderstande that yᵉ kynge hath made his othe [et] sworne that to morowe
wᵗ al his puyssaunce [et] strength he wyll haue [et] wynne the cyte.
Or elles we muste all be in jeoperdye too lese our lyues. Therfore in
aquytynge of your promyse defende [et] kepe vs from daunger lyke as
all your felowes afore haue done. to that answered yᵉ mayster [et]
sayd be of good comforte [et] fere not, for too morowe I shall by
my connynge shewe suche a werke and operacyons / that the kyng with
all his puissaunce and myght shal fle [et] leue the syege. The nexte
daye the kynge made [et] gaue a grete assaute too the cyte. Tho went
the mayster and endued or clothed hymselfe with a meruayvesture or
clothynge hauynge therin the fethers or yᵉ tayles of pecockes and of
other foules of dyuers coloures. and toke two bryght swerdes in eche
hande one. and went there with all and stode vpon the hygheste toure
of all the cyte. and began to meue and torne or shewe hymselfe aboute
on all partes towarde the oste so that they myght all beholde [et] se
hym. and he helde in his mouthe the two bryght swerdes yᵗ merueylously
shyned. They wᵗout of yᵉ kynges hoost that seyeng sayd to hym. O lorde
beholde vpon hyghest of yonder toure a wonderfull thynge or fygure. Ye
I se it wel yᵗ it is merueylous / but what it is I knowe not. They sayd
to hym It is Jhesus the god of yᵉ crysten folke yᵗ is come out of heuen
vs al to sle [et] destroye wᵗ his two swerdes yf wee here ony lenger
abyde. The kynge herynge that trembled for fere and sayde what shall
we do, there is but one way and that is that we anone go and departe
fro hens leste that theyr god auenge hvmselfe vpon vs. Tho began yᵉ
kynge wᵗ all his oste to fle, notwithstondȳge there was no nede. but
yᵗ they of yᵉ mayster were begyled [et] deceyued. And whan yᵉ romaynes
yᵗ sawe they hastely moued after al armed in good ordynaunce. [et] the
kynge wᵗ many of his people they kylled and destroyed, [et] also in
that manere by grete subtylte of yᵉ mayster was yᵉ myghty kynge wᵗ his
folke ouercomen. Then sayd thempresse to themperour, Lorde haue ye
vnderstande what I haue sayde. He sayd ye, well in yᵉ beste wyse. She
sayd, haue ye no herde what I haue sayd to you at the begynnynge of
this narracyon, of the stewarde that the kynge trusted so moche, which
for lucre of good shamed his owne wyfe, [et] he for that was dryuen
[et] banysshed out of the londe. In lyke wyse your sone for the desyre
and appetyte that he hath to the empyre, entendeth to co_n_founde and
destroye you. But while ye be in your myght [et] power do with hym as
yᵉ kynge did wᵗ his stewarde yf ye wyll not put hym to deth, banysshe
him out of your empyre, yᵗ ye without fere may leue in surete of your
lyue. And haue ye not also herde how yᵉ kyng lay before ye cyte of
Rome, [et] howe he was by the wyse maysters dec[e]yued [et] scorned yᵗ
he with his folke were kylled [et] slayne. In the same wyse yᵉ seuen
maysters entende to do wᵗ you. [et] by theyr false wyles and subtyltees
to deceyue you, [et] in the ende to sle you yᵗ your sone may regne.
Therupon answered themperour [et] sayd that shall not so be, for my
sone too morowe shal deye. Than commau_n_ded his seruaūtes that they
sholde lede his sone to hangynge. And as the folke herde that there was
a grete noyse [et] a gaderynge of theym and bewayled the dethe of yᵉ
only sone of themperour. And as yᵉ syxte mayster herde that, he hasted
hym too the Emperour [et] salued hym moche honourably, [et] he toke it
vntha_n_kfully, [et] thretned hym or menaced him to dye wᵗ his sone
for that he was wᵗ them made dompe, and a rybaude, yᵉ whiche he had
shewed vpon his wyfe. The mayster sayd. I haue deserued no deth wᵗ
your sone, but grete [et] large gyftes, for he is not dompe as ye shall
here wᵗin thre dayes yf he may lyue soo longe. and yf ye put hym too
deth for wordes of your wyfe, than shall I merueyll of your wysdome.
[et] without doute it shall happen to you as it somtyme happened to a
knyght that so moche alowed the saynges of his wyfe that he was bounde
to an horse tayle [et] drawen thrugh out all the cyte to the galowes.
Themperour sayde for the loue of god shewe me that example that I may
the better beware of that peryl. That wyl I not doo sayd the mayster,

_The Example of the Syxte Mayster._


There was an Emperour of Rome the whiche had thre knyghtes whom he
loued aboue al other. And in that same cyte was an au_n_cyent knyght yᵗ
had wedded a fayre yonge wyfe as ye do thempres whiche aboue al other
thy_n_ges he loued. This lady coude synge ryht wel, [et] melodyously
[et] wᵗ suche swetnes yᵗ many drewe to her house [et] desyred her
company / It befell vpo_n_ a season as she sate in her house, yᵉ vysage
torned in to the strete yᵗ she myght se them that we_n_t by. [et] began
swetely tu synge, yᵗ all folke delyted for to here her. By chaunce
came that wayes a knyght of yᵉ Emperours courte [et] herde that voyce,
lyft vp his eyē [et] behelde her Intentyfly [et] anone he was taken
in her loue, and entred in to her house [et] fyll in communycacyon
wᵗ her of loue. [et] amonges al other he demau_n_ded what he sholde
gyue her too slepe by hym one nyght. She answered an hondred floreyns.
The knyght sayde, tell me whan I shall come, [et] I shall gyue you an
hondred floreyns. She sayd whan I may haue a conuenyent tyme I shal
sende for you. The nexte day she sange ayen in the same place, and it
fortuned the seco_n_de knyght of themperour to come by that same way,
the whiche in lykewyse was smyten in her loue, [et] also pr_o_mysed
her an hondred floreyns. To whom also she promysed to shewe hym a tyme
prouyded. The thyrd day was the thyrd knyght in lyke wyse caught in
her loue, the whiche also promysed an ho_n_dred floreyns, [et] she too
gyue hym knowelege of the tyme. Thyse thre knyghtes haue so secretly
spoken with that lady yᵗ none of them had knowlege of other. The lady
yᵗ was of malyce [et] cautelous replenysshed, came to her husbonde [et]
sayd, syr I haue secrete maters too shewe you, [et] folowe therein my
counseyll yf ye do it, our necessite or pouerte ye may largely releue.
The knyght sayd tel it me I shal holde it secrete [et] fulfyl it to my
power. She sayde thre knyghtes of thēperours court haue ben wᵗ me one
after an other in suche wyse yᵗ none knoweth of an other counseyll.
[et] euery of them haue offred me an hondred floreyns, myght we yᵉ
thre c florayns gete [et] no knowlege therof be had sholde it not be
to vs a grete helpe [et] our pouerte well releued. The knyght sayd,
forsoth yes, [et] therfore what someuer ye cou_n_seyl me to do I shall
folowe it. Tho sayd she, I shall gyue you this counseyll. whan they
come with the floreyns ye shall stande behynde yᵉ yate wᵗ your swerde
drawen in your hande. [et] bycause yᵗ euery of them comethe alone, ye
shall sle one after another, [et] so we shal haue the three c floreyns
of them without knowlege of ony other. The knyght answered. O my best
beloued wif I fere me that this euyll can notte be hydde, and we sholde
therfore shamefully suffre dethe yf that it were knowen. She sayd I
shall this werke begynne. [et] I shall make therof a good ende, and
fere it not. wha_n_ the knyght sawe that she was so hardy it caused hym
to be the more bolde. and she sent for the fyrst knyght and he came to
hyr anone with oute ony taryenge to the yate [et] knocked, [et] she
askyd yf he brought yᵉ c floreyns. and he sayd ye, I haue theym here
all redy. Tho lete she hy_m_ in. [et] anone at yᵉ entrynge in, her
husbonde kylled hym [et] so he dyde yᵉ seconde [et] the thyrde [et] in
to one secrete chamber they drewe the bodyes of them. Whan it was thus
done yᵉ knyght sayd to his lady. O dere wyfe yf thyse bodyes be founde
wᵗ vs, we shall dye yᵉ moost shamefull deth yᵗ can be ymagyned for it
is not possyble but yᵗ thyse knyghtes shall be myssed in themperours
courte. [et] grete serche [et] Inquysyon shall be for them made thrugh
all this cyte, where they are become. She sayde, Syr I haue this werke
begonne, [et] shal make therof a good ende, fere not, as I afore sayd.
This lady had a brother the whiche had the gouernau_n_ce of the watche
of yᵉ cyte that on yᵉ nyghtis vpon stretes watched wᵗ his felowes. She
stode at her gate [et] called her brother [et] sayde. O my best brodʳ
I haue a secrete mater the whiche in co_n_fessyon I shal shewe you.
[et] therfore come a lytyll withi_n_, [et] whan yᵗ he was come in, the
knyght receyued hym frendly [et] gaue hym wyne to drynke. [et] sayd,
my well beloued broder, this is yᵉ cause yᵗ I haue called you, for of
your cou_n_seyll I haue moche nede. The broder answered say it boldely
to me, [et] what someuer yᵗ I may do, to my power, yᵗ shall be at your
desyre wᵗout letty_n_ge. Tho sayd she, yesterdaye came in a knyght in
good frendshyp / but afterwarde he fyll in suche wordes [et] varyaunce
wᵗ my husbonde, yᵗ he slewe hym, [et] lyeth in my chamber. [et] myn
owne dere broder we haue noo man that we may truste but you. [et] yf
yᵉ body were fou_n_de by vs we sholde dye. [et] she made mencyon but
of one. yᵉ brother sayd delyuer it me in a sacke [et] I shall bere
hy_m_ to yᵉ see. she herynge yᵗ was full glad thereof, [et] delyuered
to hy_m_ the body of yᵉ fyrste knyght. he toke it [et] went wᵗall a
good pase [et] cast it therin. [et] as this was done, he came ayen to
his syster [et] sayde, gyue me nowe of the beste wyne for ye are of
hym quyte. [et] she thanked hy_m_ [et] went in to as though she had
gone for wyne and began to crye wᵗ an hygh voyce, yᵉ knyghte that was
caste in to the see is come ayen. As her brother yᵗ herde he wondred
sore, [et] sayde gyue me hym. I shall se yf he shall aryse ayen. [et]
toke the body of the seconde knyght [et] wende it had ben of the fyrst
knyght [et] went to the see, [et] wᵗ a grete stone drowned hym therin.
yᵗ done, went ayen vnto his systers house [et] sayde, nowe fyll me a
cuppe with good wyne, for I haue drowned hym so depe yᵗ he shall neuer
come ayen. she sayd thanked be god [et] went ayen too her chamber [et]
fayned her to fetche wyne. [et] cryed with a grete voyce. Alas wo be to
me he is rysen ayen and come out of yᵉ see. [et] as her brother herde
that with grete meruaylle sayd. what deuyll is this knyght that I haue
thus caste in to yᵉ water [et] notwithstandynge is comen ayen. Delyuer
hy_m_ me yᵉ thyrde tyme, [et] I shall se yf he shall come ayen. Tho
gaue she hym yᵉ thyrde knxght (_sic_), whiche he byleued had ben yᵉ
fyrste knyght, [et] yede wᵗoute ye cyte to a grete foreste [et] made
a grete fyre [et] caste the knyght therin. [et] whan he was almost
brente, yᵉ brodʳ went thens a lytel dystau_n_ce to do his nede. Tho
came there a knyght yᵗ wolde ryde to yᵉ cyte where on yᵉ morny_n_ge
they sholde haue a tourneye [et] a Justy_n_g. [et] it was colde weder
[et] derke, [et] was not fer fro yᵉ cyte. As yᵗ he had a syght of that
fyre drewe therto [et] alyghted from his horse [et] warmed hy_m_.
The waker came [et] sayd to hy_m_ what arte yᵘ. The knyght sayd I am
a gentyl knyghte. Tho spake yᵉ waker [et] sayd, yᵘ arte no knyght
but a deuyll for fyrste I caste ye in to the water, the ii tyme wᵗ a
grete stone I drowned the, [et] the iii tyme I haue put yᵉ in this
fyre supposynge yᵗ yᵘ haddest be brente. [et] yet yᵘ standest here,
[et] tho he toke yᵉ knyght wᵗ his hors [et] cast them both in to the
fyre. [et] after yᵗ he went aye_n_ to his syster [et] tolde what had
hapned hy_m_. Nowe bry_n_ge me of yᵉ beste wyne, for after yᵗ I had
brente hym I fou_n_de hym ayen by yᵉ fyre wᵗ his horse, [et] I haue
caste them both in the fyre. [et] his syster perceyued well yᵗ he had
brent a knyght of the tourney whiche anone broughte hy_m_ of yᵉ best
wyne habu_n_dau_n_tly. [et] after he had wel dronken he went thens.
Not longe tyme after that there fyll a grete debate [et] co_n_tencōn
betwyx the knyghte [et] his wyfe, in such wyse yᵗ he smote her. which
had indygnacyon therof [et] waxed angry [et] sayd that many myght
here it, O wretche wyll ye kylle me as ye haue done the thre knyghts
of themperours. men yᵗ herynge layde handes on them, [et] brought
them before yᵉ emperour [et] yᵉ woman anone knowleged yᵗ hyr husbonde
had slayne the thre knyghtes of themperours [et] how he toke fro them
thre hondred floreyns [et] as it was thus in trouth fou_n_de, bothe
were drawen atte an horse tayll and hanged vppon the galowes. Than
sayd yᵉ mayster to themperour, haue ye vnderstande what I haue sayd.
He answered ryghte well. I saye for certayne that wyfe was yᵉ worste
woman that myght be of all wymme_n_, for she moued [et] styred hy_m_ to
murdre, [et] afterwarde dyscouered hym. The mayster sayd, It is wᵗoute
doubte yᵗ it shall to you happen worse yf ye put to deth your sone by
yᵉ aduyse of your wyfe. Themperour sayd, my sone shall not dye this
day. The mayster yᵗ herynge yaue thankynges to themperour, and toke
leue [et] went his waye.

Whan the empresse herde yᵗ the sone of themperour was yet lyuynge, as
a mad woman she ranne to themperour wepynge [et] cryenge. O vnhappy
wyfe what shall I doo. alas alas for I muste nedes sle myselfe yᵗ so
am ashamed [et] no punysshement there vpon done. Themperour answered,
God defende you suche thy_n_ges to haue in mynde, but suffer a whyle,
[et] ye shall haue a good ende in your cause. She answered, Syr yʳ ende
shall be euyll, for of yᵗ shal folowe to you grete co_n_fusyon [et]
to me. Themperour sayd, be styl of such thy_n_ges. She sayd, Lorde it
shall come to you [et] your sone as it happened to a kynge [et] to his
stewarde. Themperour sayd I praye you tell me that example. She sayde
I wyll gladly tell it, but I fere me that ye wyl here me no more, for
yᵉ next day yᵉ seue_n_th mayster shal speke [et] saue your sone from
yᵉ deth as his felowes haue done. The seconde day after this then your
sone shal speke, of whoos wordes ye shal haue [et] take svche joy [et]
delectacyon yᵗ the loue betwyxte vs shall bee holy forgeten [et]
wasshed away. Themperour sayd that is Impossyble to me, for I shal
neuer your loue forgete. Tho sayd she, O my best beloued lorde, please
it you I shal tel you one example, by yᵉ whiche ye shall beware before
of many perylles in tyme comynge, [et] specyally of your cursed sone,
whiche entendeth to destroy me by his maysters. The emperour sayd, tell
on your example. and the Empresse began to tell in this wyse ensuynge.

_The Seuenth Example of the Empresse._


There was somtyme a kyng, the whiche loued his wyfe aboue all thynge.
in so moche that he closed her in a stronge castell, [et] bare yᵉ keyes
of the castel hymselfe. The lady was therfore ryght heuy [et] desolate.
Now in ferre partyes there was a valyaunte knyght yᵉ whiche in a nyght
had a dreme after this effecte. For he thought that he sawe one of the
fayreste quenes yᵗ myght be. yᵉ which aboue all thynges desyred to
haue her loue. yᵗ yf he myghte se her walkynge he sholde clerely haue
knowlege of, by whome to hym grete frendshyp [et] worship sholde come.
To yᵉ quene in yᵉ same nyght by vysyon of the sayd knyght, it was to
her also shewed. [et] yet they hadde of eche other neyther knowlege of
name neyther of fame. Whan yᵉ knyght had thus dremed [et] seen in his
slepe, he thought [et] determyned in his mynde that his fote sholde not
reste vnto yᵉ tyme tyll he had founde that lady, yᵗ to hym was shewed
in his vysyon. and lepte vpon his horse / and toke with hym all that
to hym was necessarye for his journey. and rode and laboured thrughe
dyuerse regyons and londes soo longe tyll at the last he came vnto the
same londe, where that the quene was by her husbonde closed or kepte in
a stronge castel. And wha_n_ this sayd knyght was come in to yᵉ same
cyte, and by a certayne season had there soiourned, it happened on a
day as this knyght walked by the castell, and knewe not yᵗ yᵉ quene was
therin she sate in a wy_n_dowe to beholde [et] see yᵉ people goynge
by. [et] amonge all other she sawe the sayd knyght, and knewe that
he was the same man that she had dremed of. And yᵗ knyght by chaunce
lyfte vp his eyen [et] perceyued yᵉ lady syttyng in the wyndowe. [et]
anone his minde shewed hym yᵗ it was she yᵗ he the dremes of had. [et]
he began to synge a songe of loue. And as she herde yᵗ she was anone
taken wᵗ his loue. The knyghte from thensforth dayly went [et] walked
aboute yᵉ castell beholdynge it ouer all yᵗ yf in ony maner wyse he
myght gete to her too shewe his mynde. The lady perceyuy_n_ge that she
wrote a letter [et] cast it downe to hym. And whan he had sene ouer
yᵉ letter, [et] understode yᵉ wyll of that lady, he began to haunte
Joustes [et] tournamentes [et] dyde so many gret [et] merueylous actes
or dedes, that yᵉ name of hym came to the kynge. And as the kynge herde
that he sent after hym [et] sayd to hym, Syr knyght I haue herde moche
honour of you. yf it wyll please you for to abyde [et] to dwell wᵗ vs,
we shall gyue you large gyftes [et] rewardes. The knyght answerd, O
ryght myg[h]ty prynce I am your seruaunte, wolde god yᵗ I coude do ony
seruyse to please your magnyfycence, wᵗout takynge of rewarde saue one
thyng afore all other I desyre. The kynge sayd, shewe it boldely what
thynge yᵗ it is. The knyght sayd, My lorde sythen yᵗ it hath pleased
you for to take me as your seruau_n_t [et] one of youre counseyll, me
semeth that it were expedyent for bothe our solaces, that I hadde a
place nyghe too the wall of the castell: that I myght at all tymes be
the more redy at your callynge whan that ye haue nede. Then̄e the
kynge sayd I consente it to you make it as ye thy_n_ke it beste. Tho
wente the knyght [et] hyred werkeme_n_ [et] made a fayre logynge by yᵉ
walles of yᵉ toure. [et] wha_n_ it was all redy, He made a couenau_n_t
wᵗ a werkeman for to make out of his house a secret way in to yᵉ tour
[et] whan it was made redy after his entente, he kylled yᵉ werkeman
by cause he sholde not dyscouer. [et] went in to yᵉ quene [et] dyde
to her reuerence accordy_n_g [et] they talked of many thynges, yᵗ at
thende he desyred for to slepe by her, which she oftentymes denyed,
but neueryᵉles she co_n_sented to hy_m_. After yᵗ yᵉ quene thought
what shall I do, yf I sholde gyue knowlege herof vnto my husbo_n_d,
therof sholde come two euyls yᵉ one is my shame, [et] yᵗ by auenture
he sho[l]de vtterly forsake me [et] dryue me out of his londe for
euer, [et] yᵉ knyght he sholde sle, for fro yᵉ dethe he coude not
escape, [et] therfore it is better yᵗ I be styll [et] tell not. The
knyght after yᵗ as oftentymes as it pleased hym he went in to the
quene, [et] dyde his wyll with her. And she gaue hym a rynge the whiche
yᵉ kyng had gyuen vnto her at theyr weddynge. This knyght in euery
batayll and tournamēadde the vyctory wherfore he was and stode in
grete fauour with the kynge insomoche that he made hy_m_ his stewarde
[et] gouernoure of al his Regyon [et] lond. ¶ It happened vppon a daye
that the kynge dysposed hym selfe for too goo too chase or huntynge,
and he commaunded his stewarde for too make hym redy vppon the morowe
for too goo with hym, whertoo he offred hym selfe all redy. ¶ And on
the morowe after they entred in to yᵉ forest, [et] all that daye they
chased, [et] folowed yᵉ wylde bestes that they were so wery that yᵉ
kynge by a fontayne sate hy_m_ downe to reste. [et] yᵉ knyghte by yᵉ
kynge, [et] fyll on slepe by hym, hauynge yᵉ ry_n_ge vpon his fynger,
yᵉ whiche the kynge marked [et] knewe. After yᵗ the knyght perceyued yᵗ
the kynge had sene the rynge, fayned hymself seke [et] sayd, My lorde
I fele my selfe sore seke [et] yf I fynde not hastely remedy therfore
by the meanes [of] physyke I am but a dede ma_n_ [et] therfore I pray
you lycence me to go home. To whome he sayd, go my dere frend in goddes
name. he anone gate on his horse [et] hasted hy_m_ to his house, [et]
wente to the quene [et] gave her ayen yᵉ rynge, [et] tolde her how yᵉ
kynge had marked it [et] sene it on his fynger, [et] prayed her yf he
made ony questyons of yᵉ rynge yᵗ [s]he sholde shewe it to hy_m_. This
done, he went downe ayen to his lodgy_n_ge. And anone after yᵗ the
kynge came to the quene [et] she receyued hym ryght louy_n_gly, [et]
after yᵗ a lytyl tyme was passed, the kyng sayd, My lady shew me where
yᵉ ryng is that I gaue to you, I desyre to se it. O my lorde to what
entente at this tyme desyre ye to se it. Than sayd he, yf ye shewe it
not to me Inco_n_tyne_n_t it shall repente you. She rose anone vp [et]
went to [her] cheste [et] brought the ry_n_ge to yᵉ kynge. And as he
sawe yᵉ rynge he was half ashamed, [et] sayd vnto her, O howe lyke is
the knyghtes rynge vnto this rynge, whyche I sawe vpon his fynger, and
I bileued that it had ben my rynge, and therfore it was that I asked
it of you so hastely after the rynge. And of this euyll suspecyon I
yelde my selfe gylty ayenst you my dere lady, in this behalfe, for yᵉ
strength of the toure deceyued me, for I thy_n_ke yᵗ noo man myght come
therin, but I myself alone. She sayde, My dere lorde, wondʳ not for one
rynge is lyke an other, for werke men make seldome ony werke, but yᵉ
other make the same, but god forgyue it you that ye haue had me suspect
whan ye knowe the strength of yᵉ toure, [et] the keyes ye haue alway
by you, [et] byleue no man therwᵗ. After yᵗ the knyght lete ordeyn̄
a grete dyner [et] sayd to the ky_n_ge, my lorde it is so that my lady
in loue is come out of my countre [et] I haue done to be made a feste
or a dyner. [et] gladly I wolde pray you that at this tyme ye wyll doo
me honour, [et] take suche mete as is in my house. he kynge sayd I shal
gladly do you yᵗ worshypp [et] more. The knight was therof glad, [et]
by his secrete way went to the quene [et] sayd to her, My lady this
day ye shal come to my house by my preuy way, [et] clothe you in ryche
clothynge after the way of my cou_n_tre, [et] ye shal syt at the table
wᵗ the kynge as my souerayne lady, [et] make hy_m_ good there. She
sayd as ye wyll I shall it all thȳges fulfyll, [et] whan the houre of
mete was come, [et] the ky_n_ge from the castell was comyng towardes
the knyghtes house, In the meane tyme the quene entred by the secrete
way in to the knyghtes lodgynge [et] apparayled her after the maner of
the knyghtes countre. and whan the kynge was entred in to the house,
she salued hym reuerently and receyued hym. and whan the kynge hadde
beholden her he demaunded of the knyghte, what woman is this that is
so fayr. Then yᵉ knyght sayd my lorde it is my souerayne lady that
now is come out of my cou_n_tre after me. I haue taryed longe in her
seruyce. Then the knyght set the kynge att yᵉ table as it behoued. [et]
made the quene to syt by hym / [et] the kynge thoughte that it was his
quene, and sayd wᵗin hymself, O how lyke is this woman vnto my wyfe.
So yᵉ strength of the toure deceyued hym, that he gaue more fayth and
credence to yᵉ knyghtes wordes than he dyde vnto his owne eyen. The
quene began̄e for to speke [et] talke vnto the kynge and to styre
hym for to ete and drynke [et] to make good chere. And wha_n_ as the
kynge herde her voyce and speche than he sayd to hymselfe, O blessed
lady, lyke is this woman vnto my quene, in her behauyng / in speche /
in vysage / [et] in all other thy_n_ges [et] condycyons. and alwayes yᵉ
strengthe of the toure fayled hym. In the ende of yᵉ mete, yᵉ knyghte
prayed his loue to synge a songe afore yᵉ kyng the whiche began for to
synge a songe of loue. whan as he herde that [et] knewe her voyce, he
thought is not this my wyfe. How may it be she. haue not I the keyes
of yᵉ toure my selfe in kepynge. and soo all the mete tyme he sate
and strofe within hymselfe. Tho att the laste he sayde vnto the knyght
that he sholde take vp the table for he hadde somwhat for too done for
why that he sate in suche a grete thought, and aduysemēt. The knyght
answered and sayde, My lorde ye make noo good chere, ye are full of
thoughtes. And yf it please you we shall make to you more sporte [et]
solace. And the woman sayd please it you syr kynge here by vs tarye.
we shall make you all the sporte [et] solace that we can, lyke as yᵉ
quene is in her solace [et] conforte. He sayd take away the table, for
I may no lenger abyde. Then the knyght at the commaundement of yᵉ kynge
toke vp the table, [et] thanked theym all. And yᵉ kynge wente hastely
vnto the castell in serchynge whether yᵗ the quene were wᵗin or not.
And in the meane whyle the quene went vp by her preuy way, [et] put of
her vppermost vestures [et] the kynge founde her in the same clothynge
that he lefte her afore. Whan as the kynge was entred [et] so founde
her, he embraced [et] kyssed her [et] sayd vnto her. This day I haue
eten wᵗ my knyghte and wᵗ his loue that is come out of his cou_n_tree,
and sythen I was borne vnto this day myn eyen hath not sene two so
lyke creatures in al thyng as she is to you and this mete tyme I haue
be soo moche styred with dyuerse thy_n_ges yᵗ I coude no lenger abyde
there, but yᵗ I muste come [et] serche whether ye were here or theyre.
Tho sayd yᵉ quene, Syr how myght ye thynke yᵗ, for ye knowe well yᵗ
this toure is fast, [et] stronge ynoughe [et] that no body can come
in nor out wᵗout you, for ye alone haue alwayes the keye. How were
it then possyble for me to be there. Ye fynde somtyme one man lyke on
other and therfore ye sholde take none argumētes of mysdemyng or of
suspycion, as ye late dyde of the rynge. The kynge sayd, that is true
and therfore I knowlege my selfe gylty that I haue mysdemed you. After
that came to hym yᵉ knyght [et] sayd, My lorde I haue of long tyme
serued your good grace, and now it is tyme that I retourne ayen in to
my countre [et] therfore for all the seruyce yᵗ I haue done vnto you
I desyre of you but one thynge to do for me. yᵗ my lorde ye whiche I
entende to wedde in the face of the chyrche, which hath folowed me out
of ferre countrees, [et] her I shall brynge thyder ayen as my laweful
wyfe. Therfore I beseche and praye your noble grace that ye wyll do me
this honour, that by your owne honde ye wyll gyue her afore the preest
vnto me, the whiche shallbe vnto me greete honour and worshyp whan I
come into my countree. The kynge answered, yᵗ petycyon and more yf ye
desyre it that shall I gladly doo and fulfyll it. The knyght prefyxed
the daye of maryage. To the whiche daye this good kynge came to the
chyrche worshypfully. The preest was redy [et] stode indued wᵗ his
vestymentes for to solemnyse the matrymonye. The knyght had the quene
all redy apparayled in his owne house after his maner [et] had ordeyned
two knyghtes for to lede her to the chyrche, they byleuynge that it had
ben his paramour. And whan they were before in the face of yᵉ chyrche
yᵉ preest sayd, who shall gyue this woman vnto this knyght. Then the
ky_n_ge sayd, I shall gyue her to myn owne knyght. and toke her by the
hande [et] sayd vnto her, O good woman ye are moche lyke vnto my quene,
and therfore I loue you the better, and also for that ye be my knyghtes
wyfe and shall be of my house. and putte the quenes hande in to yᵉ
knyghtes hand. and yᵉ preest after yᵉ maner of the chyrche hath bounde
[et] wedded them togyder. and whan all this was fynysshed [et] done the
knyghte sayd vnto yᵉ kyng, Syr my shyp yᵗ I entende to go in towardes
my countre is all redy to make sayle wherfore I humbly beseche hyghly
your moost noble grace that it wyl please you for to accompany my
wy[fe] therunto [et] that ye wyll aduertyse [et] enfourme her[4] that
she loue me [et] haue me in fauoure aboue all other creatures lyuynge,
and the rather for your gode excytacyon [et] doctryne. Thenne the kynge
with a grete multytude of people went with theym [et] accompanyed theym
vnto the shyppe of whoos departynge many of them were dolaunte to the
shyppe. the kynge began to say vnto the quene, my moost dere frende,
herken now well vnto my counseyll and folowe it, for it shall be for
your honour [et] proufyte. My knyght hath now here wedded [et] done to
you al yᵉ worshypp yᵗ in hym is. wherfore loke yᵗ ye loue [et] honour
hym aboue all erthly creatures [et] yᵗ hath god commaunded [et] that ye
be too hym true [et] obedyent. [et] as this was sayd he delyuered her
vnto yᵉ knyght saynge my blessyng go wᵗ you both, [et] our lorde kepe
[et] conduyte you in sauete to your cou_n_tre. Then the knyght and the
quene bowed and enclyned down̄ her hedes vnto yᵉ kynge. [et] thanked
hym of all thyngs and they commytted hym to god and entred in to the
shyppe and the maryners haled up the sayles and sayled forth afore the
wynde soo that wᵗin a short tyme the kyng had lost yᵉ syght of the
shyp. And from the_n_s he went hastely to yᵉ castell [et] myssed the
quene. [et] wha_n_ he founde her not / he was meued in all the partes
of his body. [et] sought all about yᵉ toure and serched, tyll at laste
he founde yᵉ hole or yᵉ secrete way yᵗ the knyght had made. [et] as he
saw that, than cryed he and weped and sayd, Alas alas this knyght in
whom I hadde so grete confydence [et] truste hath taken away my wyfe,
was I not a fole yᵗ I gaue more fayth in to his words then I dyde to
myne owne eyen. Than sayd thempresse, My lorde haue ye vnderstand what
I haue sayde. Themperour sayd ryght wel in yᵉ best wyse. Then sayd
thempresse, remember how yᵗ he trusted the knyghte [et] yet he deceyued
hy_m_. In the same manere wyse ye haue confydence in the seuen wyse
maysters / and they laboure for to destroye me that am your wyfe. [et]
ye gyue more fayth vnto theyr wordes than ye do vnto your owne eyen.
for ye haue well sene how yᵗ youre sone rente and scratched me. Wherof
yet I bere and haue the tokens [et] the markes as ye may see. And also
ye knowe well how that your cursed sone hath me ashamed [et] ye marke
not howe they defende hym in his foly and falshede. Therfore it is to
be dradde yᵗ it shall happen to you as it dyde to the kynge that too
you I haue spoken of. Themperour sayd, I byleue myn eyen better than
theyr wordes. [et] therfore I say you yᵗ to morowe I shall do justyce
of hym. On yᵉ morowe the Emperour commaunded that his sone sholde be
hanged. Tho began ayen a grete noyse in and [bewailing amongst the
common people for the death of the Emperor's only son. At last when the
seventh master heard it, he ran immediately unto the officers, which
were leading him to the gallows, and said: My friends, I pray you not
to make overmuch haste but stay your hands a while, for I think this
day (with the help of the Almighty God) to save him from all perils;
and from thence the master hasteth himself to the Emperor's Palace, and
did him reverence according to his accustomed duty. But the Emperor
with great indignation made him this answer: Never more have you any
joy in this world, for that you have sent my son home untaught and
dumb, whom I delivered unto you well speaking, for which cause you
shall all be put to death with him. The master answered: O most noble
Emperor, the time is not long betwixt this and tomorrow noon; then
(by the grace of God) you shall hear him speak discreetly, and shall
declare the truth of all things, and this I promise you he will perform
to the full, upon pain of my life, if you will spare him so long a
time; if you find it not so, then take my life and the lives of us all.
Then said the Emperor: If I might but hear my son speak, it would give
me sufficient content, and I would not desire longer to live. Then
answered the master: All this and more you shall hear and see, and
confess it to be true, if you will but abide this little time: and then
the strife that hath been betwixt us and the Empress will clearly be
decided. And if you suffer him to be put to death through the words of
your most ungodly wife, I tell you of a truth it shall happen worse to
you than it did to a knight that died for a little blood that he saw
his wife to bleed, to whom afterwards she was most unnatural. Then said
the Emperor: That example I would fain hear. Then said the master: Let
your son be called again, and I shall tell you so notable an example
that during your life you may beware of the unsteadfastness of woman.
Then the Emperor said: I shall go call my son again upon condition that
tomorrow I shall hear him speak as you have promised. The master said:
Do that, my lord, for it shall so be. And began to tell as followeth.]

_The Example of the Seuenth Mayster._


There was a knyght yᵗ had a fayre yonge wyfe whome he entyrely loued in
so moche that he coude not be out of her syght. It hapned on a tyme yᵗ
they played togyder at the chesse, [et] yᵉ knyght by chau_n_ce helde
a knyfe in his hande [et] she playng fortuned to smyte her hand vpon
yᵉ knyf, yᵗ a lytel blode began to appere. Whan yᵉ knyght sawe that
his wyfe bled he sorowed moche and was sore aferde of his wyfe yᵗ he
fel to the grounde in a swoune. his wyfe cast colde water vpon his
vysage, yᵗ he a lytell came ayen too hymselfe [et] sayd lyghtely call
the curate wᵗ the holy sacramente for I muste deye for the blood yᵗ I
haue seen come out of your fy_n_ger hath smyten the deth to my herte.
The preest came and houseled hym. [et] anone after he dyed wᵗout ony
taryeng, for whoos deth there was made grete sorowe [et] bewayly_n_ges
and specyally of yᵉ wyfe. And after that the obsequyes [et] buryenge
was done accordynge she went and lay vpon the buryel or graue and there
she made the gretest sorowe of the worlde, and sayd that she wolde
neuer departe from thens, but as a turtyll douue she wolde for the
loue of her husbonde there abyde [et] dye. Tho went her fren[ds] vnto
her and sayd what auayleth this for his soule to lyue [et] dye here,
it is better yᵗ ye go to your house [et] gyue almes for yᵉ loue of god
[et] yᵗ shal more auayle his soule, than in this place to abyde. To
whom she answerd be styll ye are euyll co_u_nselours. Co_n_syder not
ye how I am fro hy_m_ seperate [et] departed by his deth for a lytell
blode yᵗ he sawe com out of my ho_n_d or fy_n_ger,[et] therfore I shall
neuer fro hens departe. Her frendes hery_n_ge yᵗ lete make a lytell
house or lodgynge nygh vnto yᵉ graue, [et] put therin all thynges yᵗ
to her was necessarye [et] went theyr wayes thy_n_kynge that within a
whyle she sholde be wery to be alone, [et] so desolate from all company
[et] yᵗ therby she sholde desyre ayen yᵉ company of people. In yᵗ cyte
was thenne a lawes (_sic_) yᵗ whan a trespassour or offendour ayenst
the lawe were hanged, yᵗ yᵉ shyryf all yᵗ nyght sholde watche [et] kepe
the body all armed, [et] yf it hapned yᵗ the body of hym hanged were
stolen away, yᵉ seryf sholde lese all his londe, [et] his lyfe at yᵉ
kynges pleasure. It hapned sone after yᵗ the knyghte was dede a man
to be hanged for trepasse that he had done, so that yᵉ sheryf after
yᵉ lawe of the londe all the nyght watched by yᵉ galowes yᵗ was not
fer fro yᵉ cyte, [et] yᵉ chyrcheyerde was not ferre from the walles of
yᵉ same. Tho became yᵉ sheryf so colde yᵗ he wyst not but to dye for
colde, wᵗout the rather yᵗ he myghte warme hym. it was so feruent a
colde [et] so stronge a froste, and he behelde fro thens about hym [et]
sawe yᵉ fyre in yᵉ chyrcheyerde, [et] hasted hym [et] came therto,
[et] whan he was come he called [et] knocked at the lytyll house. The
woman spake who is that yᵗ at this houre is knockynge at yᵉ house of
this sorowfull woman. I am yᵉ shyref that so moche colde suffreth yᵗ
wᵗout anone ye late me in I shall frese to deth. She sayd, I fere me yf
that I lete you come in ye sholde shewe me such wordes yᵗ sholde cause
me for to be more heuyer. [et] he sayd I promyse vnto you yᵗ I shall
saye no wordes to your dyspleasure. Then lete she hym in. and whan he
awhyle had sytten by yᵉ fyre [et] was well warmed he sayd to her, O
fayre woman wᵗ your lycence wolde I fayne speke but one worde vnto you.
She answered to hym, syr say what it pleaseth you. He sayd, O lady ye
be a fayr gentyl woman ryche [et] yonge. were it not better [et] more
conuenyent for you to dwell at home in your house [et] to gyue almesse
than to destroye [et] consume your lyfe here wᵗ wepynes [et] cryenges.
She sayde syr knyght had I knowen this afore ye had not come herin for
I say to you, as I haue sayd too other oftentymes, ye knowe well yᵗ
my husbonde loued me so well that for a lytyll bloode yᵗ he sawe me
blede on one of my fyngers he is dede, wherfore I shall here deye for
the loue of hym. As the knyght herde this he toke leue and wente to
the galowes [et] whan he was there come, he sawe yᵗ the theef that he
left there hangynge was stolen [et] caryed awaye, [et] began therfore
to wexe heuy [et] full of sorowe, [et] sayd, wo is me what shall I do
for I haue loste my lyfe and all my good. And he goynge thus full of
sorowe [et] heuynesse, [et] wyste not whyche waye to torne hym or to
go, at the laste bethought hym to go to yᵗ deuoute [et] desolate lady,
[et] shewe vnto hyr yᵉ heuynesse of his herte, to wyte yf yᵗ she coude
gyue hym ony gode counseyll. And whan he was theder come he called,
[et] she axed the cause of his knockynge. Tho sayd he, madame I am
the shyref that was here ryght now wᵗ you, [et] I wolde feyne shewe
you yᵉ secretes of myn herte. Therfore I praye you for yᵉ loue of god
open the dore. and he wente in [et] sayd to her O moost vertuous lady
I come to haue your counseyll and aduys, for ye knowe well yᵉ lawe of
yᵉ londes are that whan so euer ony man is hanged [et] stolen awaye
of the galowes, than the shyref his lyfe and godes be in yᵉ kynges
handes. Nowe it is happened in yᵉ tyme that I was here with you [et]
warmed me, yᵉ theef is stolen away frome yᵉ galowes, therfore I praye
you for the loue of god gyue me your aduys what is me beste to do. She
answered I haue compassyon vpon you, for by the lawe ye haue loste lyfe
[et] goodes to yᵉ kynge. Do nowe after my cou_n_seyll, [et] ye shall
neyther lese lyfe ne godes. He answered therfore I came to you hopynge
to haue gode comforth. She sayd wyll ye than promyse to take me to your
wyfe. the knyght answered, wolde god that ye wolde do yᵗ, but I fere me
leste yᵗ ye wolde dysdeyne so moche to humble you too me yᵗ am so pore
a knyght. She sayd I gyue you my wyl therto, [et] he yaue her ayen his
wyll [et] consented too be her knyght durynge his lyfe. Tho sayd she,
ye knowe well yᵗ suche a daye my lorde was buryed whiche for yᵉ loue
of me deyed, take hym oute of his sepulture, [et] go hange hym in stede
of yᵉ theef. The knyght answered lady your cou_n_seyll is good. Tho
went they togyder [et] opened the graue [et] drewe hym out. The knyght
sayd howe shall we nowe doo, by cause or the theef was taken, two of
his vpper tethe were smyten oute, [et] I fere me yf yᵗ were perceyued I
shold be dede. She sayd to hym, take a stone and stryke oute two of his
tethe. The knyght answered, madame yᵗ may not do for while he lyued he
was my wel beloued felowe [et] it sholde be to me a grete rebuke, yf I
cōmytted soo dysloyall a dede vnto his body beynge dede. She answered
for your loue I shall do it, [et] toke a stone [et] smote out two of
his tethe, [et] sayd to the shyref, take hy_m_ [et] hange him vpon yᵉ
galowes lyke to yᵉ theef. The knyght sayde I fere me to do it, for yᵉ
theef in takynge of hy_m_ was wou_n_ded in yᵉ hede, [et] he wanted both
his eres, [et] therfore yf it were serched [et] founde otherwyse, it
sholde be to my vtter vndoynge. Than sayd she, take out your swerde
[et] make hym a grete wounde in his hede, [et] cut of his eres. O
madame god forbede yᵗ I do yᵗ to the dede body yᵗ I loued so well in
hys lyfe. Than sayd she, gyue me your swerde [et] I shal for yᵉ loue
of you do it. [et] toke yᵉ swerde [et] smote a manly stroke vpon yᵉ
dede mānes forhede, [et] cut of bothe his eres. And whan she hadde thus
done, sayd, now take [et] hange hym wᵗout company. [et] than yᵉ knyght
answered, yet I fere me to ha_n_ge hy_m_, for yᵉ theef wanted both his
stones, [et] yf that were serched [et] fou_n_de wᵗout, all your labour
were in vayn. Then sayd she, I sawe neuer so feerfull a man seyng yᵉ
mater so clere [et] sure. Take a knyfe [et] cut of his stones. And he
answered, yᵗ may I not do in no wyse and therfore I pray you spare me,
[et] yᵉ knowe well what a man is wᵗout his stones. She sayd for yᵉ
loue of you I shall do it. And toke ye knyf in her hande [et] cutte
of husbondes stones, and [sayd] to hym, nowe take this churle thus
dysfygured and hange hym vp withoute drede. And went forth togyder and
henge vp the body vpo_n_ yᵉ galowes [et] so was the shyref delyuered
out of the ky_n_ges daunger. Tho sayd yᵉ lady, now be ye quyte of all
your daungeours [et] fere [et] all thy sorowes by my cou_n_seyll. And
therfore I wyll yᵗ ye wedde me in yᵉ face of yᵉ chyrche. The knyghte
sayde I haue made a vowe yᵗ I shal neuer wed other as longe as ye lyue,
which I wyl holde. but afterwarde he sayd, O yᵉ moost shameful [et]
worst woma_n_ of al wȳmen who wolde take ye to his wyfe. An honourable
[et] a louynge knyght was thy husbo_n_de, whiche for a lytel blode yᵗ
he sawe of thy fy_n_ger shed dyed. now haste yᵘ smyten out two of his
tethe, yᵘ haste cutte of his eeres, [et] his stones, [et] yᵘ haste made
hy_m_ a grete wounde in his hede, what deuyll wolde wed yᵉ, [et] by
cause yᵗ yᵘ shal neuer shame more good man, I shal rede yᵉ, [et] drewe
his swerde [et] wᵗ one stroke he smote of her hede. The mayster sayd,
My lorde haue ye vnderstande what I haue sayd. The emperour sayd, ryght
well. Amonges all wymmen was this yᵉ worste [et] the knyght rewarded
her accordynge so as she sholde no more men shame. And the_m_perour
sayd more ouer, O my good mayster myght I ones here my sone speke I
sholde gyue no charge of my lyfe. Tho sayd the mayster, To morowe ye
shall here hym speke afore you [et] afore al yᵉ lordes of thempyre,
[et] he shall shewe yᵉ very trouth of all yᵉ varyaunce betwyxte vs [et]

How yᵗ Dyoclesyan themperours sone co_m_playned on thempres, [et] how

And after yᵗ all the maysters assembled togydʳ [et] toke theyr counseyll
how [et] in what maner they shold brynge out yᵉ	chylde of pryson [et]
lede to the palays. [et] tho they went to yᵉ chylde there as he laye

whome yᵉ chylde sayd, what yᵗ shall please you, shall please me, but in
no wyse besye you not howe yᵗ I shall answere, or what I shall saye,
for wᵗ joye I shal answere to all thy_n_ges yᵗ shal be demau_n_ded

clothed hym in purpure [et] in clothe of golde. [et] two maysters went

[et] yᵉ other thre folowed hym after. [et] afore them al went xxiiii
men wᵗ dyuerse instruments of musyke [et] brought hym wᵗ grete melody
and honour to yᵉ palays. And whan themperour herde al this melody, he
demau_n_ded what it was. Then it was tolde hym, Syr emperour it is
your sone, yᵉ which cometh tofore you [et] afore all your lordes to
speke and excuse hy_m_selfe of all thynges yᵗ are layde to his charge /
Themperour sayd, yᵗ is good tydy_n_ges, myght I here my sone speke. And
whan ye chylde was come to ye palays he ran vnto his fader [et] sayd
vnto hy_m_, hayle fader [et] my moost honourable. And whan themperour
herde yᵉ voyce of his sone he was so glad yᵗ for joye he fyl downe to
yᵉ erthe. but yᵉ chylde toke hym lyghtly vp ayen. and whan he was come
ayen to hy_m_self, tho begā [the son to declare the whole matter to
his father, and there came so great a multitude to the palace to hear
the child speak, and the noise of them was so great that the child
could not be heard. The emperour considering that, caused money to be
thrown into the streets, that the people therwith should be busied out
of the palace, the better to hear the child speak; but they regarded
not the money. When the emperor perceived that he commanded silence on
pain of death. And when they were all still, the child began to speak
as followeth: O most dear father, before I speak anything, I entreat
you that the empress with all her chamber-maids may be present. So the
emperor commanded the empress with all her maids to come without delay.
The empress hearing that (in great fear) came with her maids; and the
child bade them to stand before the people in a row that he might see
them. Then said the child, Sir, behold the chamber-maid that standeth
there in green (whom ye know the empress loveth above all others),
command her to be uncloathed before us all, and see what she is. The
emperor said, Dear son, that would shame us all, to have a woman stand
naked before us. He said, If it be a woman it is my shame; if not, let
the shame abide in her. When she was uncloathed she appeared to be a
man, whereat they wondered.]

[_The Complaint of the Emperor's Son on the Empress._]


Thenne sayd the sone vnto the fader, beholde this rybaude that many a
nyghte hathe with your wyfe lyen in your chamber in auoutrye, [et] haue
defouled your bedde. [et] therfore the empresse loued hym so well, the
whiche ye knewe not. whan the emperour sawe yᵗ he was impacyent [et]
wrothe, yᵗ he cōmau_n_ded yᵗ she with yᵉ rybaude sholde be brent. yᵉ
sone sayd, lorde fader make no haste of yᵗ iugement before that I haue
reproued her of the cryme yᵗ she layde vpon me falsely, [et] that she
vntruly [et] falsly hathe complayned [et] lyed vpon me. Tho sayd the
fader, My dere sone I cōmytte all the iugemente in to your hands. The
sone answered yf she be founde false [et] a lyer yᵉ lawe shall iuge
her. But my dere fader whan ye sent after me at yᵉ instaunce of hyr,
then I with my maysters behelde the sterres in yᵉ fyrmamente. [et]
there we sawe yᵗ yf I sholde speke ony worde within seuen dayes I
sholde haue deyed a shamefull dethe, and therefore that was the cause
that I spake not. And where as the empresse sayd [et] put vnto me, that
I wolde haue oppressed [et] rauysshed hyr, in yᵗ she lyeth falsly but
she dyd hyr best to haue caused me to do it. And wha_n_ she in no wyse
coude bryng me therto, she toke me paper penne [et] ynke, [et] badde
me wryte the cause why yᵗ I refused her. And whan yᵗ I had wryten yᵗ
I wolde not do or commytte so greate [et] abhomynable synne, and also
wolde not my faders orcharde defoule, tho began she to tere hyr clothes
[et] scratche her vysage yᵗ it ran on blode, [et] cryed wᵗ a loude
voyce, [et] cōmytted vnto me the cryme or blame. And whan yᵉ Emperoure
herde this he behelde her wᵗ a fell cou_n_tenau_n_ce, and sayd to her
in this maner, O thou wretched woman was it not suffycyent to fulfyll
thy foule [et] lecherous appetyte I [et] thy rybaude, but wolde also
haue hadde my sone. Than fell the Empresse to themperours fote [et]
she cryed hym mercy. Then yᵉ Emperoure sayd, O thou cursyd [et] most
vnhappy woman thou askest forgyuenesse [et] thou art worthy none to
haue, for yᵘ haste deserued to dye in thre maner wyse. The fyrst is yᵗ
yᵘ haste done auoutrye. The seconde is that thou haste prouoked and
styred my sone to syne [et] haste to hym commytted, [et] layde yᵉ cryme
falsely [et] vntruly. And yᵉ thyrde yᵗ thou haste euery daye entyced
[et] prouoked me wᵗ thy false tales for to put hym to dethe. [et]
therfore yᵉ lawe shall haue yᵉ course vpon ye, [et] iuge the to the
dethe. Then sayd the sone, Fader ye knowe well, that for yᵉ lesynge
that she lyed vpon me, I was dayly lad to hangynge. But god with the
helpe of my maysters hathe delyuered me. O my moost honourable fader,
it was sayd vnto you by yᵉ Empresse that I wolde also by yᵉ helpe of
my maysters depose you out of youre Empyre, [et] that I laboured to
dystroye you, [et] for to sette me in your place. Sholde not ye then
haue sorowed, Ye haue the Empyre to gouerne, [et] wherfore shold I
not holde you for my fader. God defende that, for of you I haue my
lyuyng. And I shall holde and repute you for my souerayne lorde and
fader durynge the terme of my lyfe. And I will not in ony manere
depryue you of youre honoure, but I shall laboure and besye my selfe
about the gouernau_n_ce of yᵉ same, and all your cōmau_n_dementes I
shall fulfyll in every thy_n_ge. But it is in lyke wyse as the fader
caste his sone in to the see for too drowne hym, bycause he sayd yᵗ
he in tyme comynge sholde be his lorde, [et] yet yᵉ sone by the helpe
of god was saued, and was made a gretter lorde than he was, [et] yet
was it no hynderau_n_ce to the fader but prouffyte. Also ye sholde
see [et] remembre yᵗ my lyfe [et] gouernau_n_ce shall neuer hynder
you but it shal be to your greate solace [et] joye. Than sayd yᵉ
Emperoure, blessed be almyghty god [et] the houre yᵗ I euer begate
you, [et] deserued to haue such a sone yᵗ I fynde soo wyse [et] good
in all thynges. Telle me nowe an example by yᵉ whiche I maye parfytly
thy wysdome vnderstande, & that myn herte maye the better joye in the.
Thenne sayd the sone fyrst cōmau_n_de sylence to your people yᵗ I be
not letted in my wordes tyll yᵗ I haue done. And whan yᵗ it is ended,
gyue sentence wᵗ yᵉ ryght wysnesse of the lawe vpon me and vpon the

_The Example of Dyoclesyan the Emperours sone._


There was a knyght whiche hadde but one sone that he loued ryght moche

mayster of ferre cou_n_trees to nourysshe [et] to lerne. yᵉ chylde was

fader desyred to see hym, [et] sent letters to hym yᵗ he sholde come
ayen in to his cou_n_tree [et] vysyte his frendes in lyke wyse as ye
haue sente for me. The chylde was obedyent to his fader [et] came at
his cōmau_n_dement of whos comynge he joyed moche, for yᵗ he was as
well growen in his membres as in doctryne. To euery man he appered
pleasau_n_t and gentylle. It happened vpon a daye yᵗ the fader and
the moder syttynge at yᵉ table, [et] the chylde seruynge theym, a
nyghtyngale came fleynge afore yᵉ wyndowe where as they satte, [et]
began for to synge so swetely yᵗ they merueyled. And yᵉ knyght sayd,
O how swetely this byrde syngeth, well were hym yᵗ coude vnderstande
his songe, [et] coude shew the interpretacyon therof. Thenne the sone
sayd, my worshypfull fader the song of the nyghtyngale I coude well
declare, but I fere your dysplesure. The fader sayd, saye hardely my
sone yᵉ interpretacyon of yᵉ byrde, [et] than ye shall proue whether I
shall be angry or not, but I shall marke well yᵉ reason of myn angre.
[et] whan yᵉ sone herde yᵗ he sayd, yᵉ nyghtyngale hath sayd in his
songe, that I shall become a grete lorde, yᵗ I shall be honoured [et]
worshypped of all men, [et] namely of my fader, the whiche shall brynge
the water for to wasshe in myn handes, and my moder shall holde the
towell. The fader sayd thou shall neuer see yᵗ day suche seruyce of vs
to haue, nor none suche dygnyte shall folowe the, and in greate malyce
[et] wodenesse he toke his sone vppon his sholders [et] ranne to the
see [et] cast hym in it, and sayd, Lye there the interpretatour of yᵉ
byrdes songe. The chylde coude swymme, and swymmed to a londe where he
was foure dayes without mete or drynke. The fyft daye there came a shyp
saylynge, and as the chyld sawe that, he called loude to the shypmen
[et] sayd for the loue of god delyuer me frome the peryll of dethe.
The shypmen sawe that it was a fayre yonge man they had compassyon on
hy_m_ and went with theyr bote and sette hym aborde and in to ferre
countrees with them they ledde hym and solde hym there to a duke. The
chylde grewe goodly and fayre, [et] the duke loued hym moche, [et]
hadde him gretely in his fauoure. Uppon a tyme the kynge of yᵗ realme
lete calle and assemble all the greate lordes [et] noble men of his
londe to a generall cou_n_sell. This duke prepared [et] ordeyned hym
to go to yᵉ cou_n_sell, [et] marked the wysdome [et] the wytte of the
chylde [et] toke the chylde with hym. And whan they were all gadred
[et] assembled before the kynge in his cou_n_seyll My welbeloued
lordes [et] frendesō sayd yᵉ kynge, wylle ye wete yᵉ cause wherfore
yᵗ I haue called you to this counseylle. Then sayd they all we be all
souerayne lorde at your commau_n_demente. Then yᵉ kynge sayd, It is a
secrete mater yᵗ I shall shewe you, yf yᵗ ony ma_n_ can open it [et]
declare what yᵗ it sygnyfyeth, I swere [et] promytte vnto hym by my
crowne yᵗ I shall gyue too hym myn only doughter in maryage, [et] he
shal be my felowe in my realme duryng my lyfe, [et] after my dethe he
shall haue [et] possede all the hole kyngedome, [et] yᵉ mystery of
the counseyll is this. Thre rauons alwayes folowe me where so euer
that I goo. they leue me not, but cry wᵗ suche horryble voyces, yᵗ it
is grete payne for me to here them, [et] to beholde theyr lokynges.
[et] therfore yf ther be ony man yᵉ whiche that knoweth the cause of
theyr folowynge, [et] can shewe what they mene by theyr cryenge [et]
voyde theym fro me, wᵗout doubte I shall fulfyll this promyse yᵗ I
haue made. [et] as the kynge had thus sayd, there was none fou_n_de in
all the cou_n_seyll yᵗ wyst the cause or coude moue or put awaye the
rauons. Then sayd yᵉ chylde too the duke. My lorde thynke ye that the
kynge wyl holde his promyse or worde yf I accomplysshe his wyll and
desyre. Than yᵉ duke sayde I thynke he wyll holde yᵗ he hath promysed,
but wyl ye yᵗ I gyue the kynge knowledge of you what ye can do. Then
yᵉ chylde sayd, I wyl my lyfe set in pledge [et] I shall perfourme
[et] make it good yᵗ I haue sayd. Whan yᵉ duke herde that he went to
the kynge [et] sayd, My lorde the kyng, here is a yong ma_n_ that is
ryght connynge [et] wyse, the whiche promyseth for to satysfye [et]
fulfyl in al thy_n_ges your desyre as touchy_n_ge the rauons yf ye
wyll fulfyll that ye haue promysed. The kynge swore by the crowne of
his kyngdome, what I haue promysed in al thynges shalbe fulfylled. Tho
brought he yᵉ chylde before the kynge, and whan the kynge sawe hym he
spake to hym. O fayre chylde can ye gyue answere to my questyon. The
chylde sayd, my lorde ye in the best wyse, your questyon is wherfore
yᵗ the rauons folowe you [et] horrybly crye vpon you. To whiche I
answere. Upon a tyme it hapned that two rauons a male [et] a female
had brought forthe bytwene them the thyrde rauon. vpon the sayd se was
so grete famyne [et] scarsytee of all maner of thy_n_ges yᵗ men bestes
[et] foules dyed [et] perysshed for defaute. The thyrde rauon yᵗ tyme
beynge yonge in the nest the moder lefte it sekynge where she myght
best gete her lyuynge, [et] came no more to yᵉ neste. The male rauon
seynge that with grete penurye and laboure fed the yong rauon tyll
that he was able to flye and wha_n_ the dere tyde was passed and gone
then the female rauon came ayen too the yonge rauon and wolde holde
felysshyppe and company with hym. And as the male rauon sawe that, he
wolde haue dryuen her away, saynge thus, that she in his grete myscheyf
and necessyte lefte hym and his company, and therfore nowe she sholde
wante his company and felysshyppe. She alledged and sayd that she
had in his byrthe grete laboure and sorowe, and suffred penurye, and
therfore of his company she sholde rather joye than the fader. For this
my souerayne lorde they folowe you askynge the ryght jugement whiche
of them both shal haue the yonge rauon in theyr company, and this is
the cause of theyr horryble clamour and noyse that they make dayly
vpon you. But my lorde hadde ye hereupon a ryght wysse sentence gyuen
ye sholde neuer more see theym or be troubled wᵗ theyr cryenge. Tho
sayd the kynge, for the cause that the moder hath left [et] forsaken
the yonge rauen in his mooste necessyte, it standeth with reason [et]
iustyce yᵗ she shall wante [et] be without his felyshyp. And where
yᵗ she sayth [et] alledgethe yᵗ in the berynge [et] byrth of hym she
hadde greate payne and traueyle, that helpeth her not, for yᵗ payne was
torned in to joye as sone as she sawe the yonge rauen in the worlde.
But for yᵗ the male is yᵉ cause of produccyon [et] generacyon in euery
beste, [et] also yᵗ he the yong rauon in his necessyte sustayned [et]
fedde in to the recoueryng [et] nourysshynge of his body, therfore
I gyue for a iugement [et] for a sentence dyffinityue yᵗ the yonge
rauen shall abyde [et] holde company wᵗ the fader and not with the
moder. And whan the rauons herde this sentence, with a greate noyse
[et] crye they flewe vp in the ayre [et] were no more seen ne fou_n_de
in all that Regyon. Whanne that this was doone yᵉ kynge demaunded of
the yonge man what his name was. He answered I am called Alexander.
Tho sayd the kynge, I wyll haue one thynge of you, yᵗ ye frome hens
forth shal name [et] take me [et] none other for your fader but me,
for ye shall marye my doughter, and ye shall be possessour of all my
realme. The yonge Alexander abode and dwelled stylle with the kynge,
and euery man hadde too hym fauour and loue, for he began to haunt and
occupy hymselfe in iustes [et] in tourneys, wherin at all tymes he
had the pryse aboue all other yᵗ were in all Egypte, soo yᵗ his pere
or lyke was not founde, [et] there was not so harde nor so obscure a
questyon put vnto hym but yᵗ he coude assoyle it. At that tyme was
there an Emperoure named Tytus, that excelled in gentylnesse, curtesy
[et] curposyte [curiosity] of all other Emperours kynges and prynces
in yᵉ worlde. In so moche yᵗ suche a fame [et] noyse flewe [et] ranne
ouer all the worlde of it, yᵗ what so euer he was yᵗ wolde prouffyte
in connynge maners or behauynge, that he sholde go to the Emperours
courte. And whan Alexander herd that he sayd to the kynge my most
honourable fader [et] lorde ye wote well that al the worlde is full
of the fame of themperoure so yᵗ it is delectable to abide [et] dwel
in hys courte wherfore yf it please yow my lorde [et] fader I wolde
gladly go to hys court that I myght be wyser [et] prompter in maners
[et] behauy_n_ge than I am. Thereupon answered yᵉ kynge, It pleaseth
me ryght well, but I wolde that ye take with you plente of golde [et]
syluer [et] other necessaryes, so moche yᵗ ye myn honoure ther wᵗ may
saue, [et] yᵗ ye may haue also yᵗ is to you requysyte [et] behouefull.
And also me semeth it were expedyent yᵗ ye afore your departyng sholde
mary my doughter. Tho answerd Alexander wyll it please you my lorde
too spare me at this tyme [et] at my comynge home ayen I shall wedde
hir wᵗ all honoure as to her apperteyneth. The kynge answered, sythen
it is your wyll to go to themperours court I lycence you and therto I
consente. Alexander toke leue of the kynge, [et] toke with hym tresoure
ynoughe [et] went to themperours courte. And whan he was come with a
fayre companye, he wente afore the Emperoure [et] felle on his knees,
and salued hym [et] dyd hym reuerence. Themperoure rose frome his sete
imperyall and kyssed hym, [et] asked of hym of whens [et] what he
was, [et] wherfore he was comen. He answered and sayd I am sone [et]
heyre to the kynge of Egypte, [et] am come to do seruyce to your moost
hyghe maieste yf it please you to accepte me. Themperour sayd yᵗ he
was ryght welcome, [et] cōmytted hym to his stewarde and made hym his
keruer. The stewarde ordeyned hym a fayre chamber [et] purueyed hym
all thynges yᵗ were necessary to the same. And Alexander behaued hym
so well [et] wysely yᵗ in shorte tyme of all people he was beloued.
Not longe after that came yᵉ kynges sone of Fraunce to do seruyse to
themperoure [et] to lerne nurture, whome themperour receyued honourably
and demau_n_ded his name [et] of what kynred he was come. He answered
I am sone to the kynge of Frau_n_ce, [et] I haue to name Lodwyke your
seruau_n_te. Tho sayd the Emperoure I haue made Alexander my karuer,
[et] ye shall be my cuppe berer. yᵗ alwayes ye shall do seruyse
afore me at my table. [et] cōmau_n_ded his stewarde to assygne hym a
lodgynge, whome he assygned wᵗ Alexander in his chamber. These were soo
lyke in stature, in vysage, [et] in condycyons yᵗ vnneth yᵉ one myght
be dyscerned fro yᵉ other. but yᵗ Alexander was more in cōnyng [et]
lyghtlyer in his dedes than Lodwyke was, for Lodwyke was a femynyne
man [et] shamfast. [et] these two yong men loued well togyder. This
Emperoure had a doughter oonly, named Florentyne, yᵉ which was ryght
fayr [et] gracyous, [et] shold be his heyre whome he loued entyerly,
which had a courte by her selfe [et] seruau_n_tes to her assygned. To
whome yᵉ Emperour euery daye was accustomed to sende frome his table of
his deyntes, in tokenyng of loue by yᵉ hande of Alexander, wherupon yᵉ
doughter began to haue hym meruaylouslye in her fauoure bycause of his
wysdome [et] his gracyous demenure. It hapned vpon a day Alexander at
the mete tyme had suche a besynesse yᵗ he serued not at yᵉ table nor
none other gaue attendau_n_ce for hym in his rowme. Lodwyke perceyued
yᵗ [et] serued in his stede. And whan he had serued the Emperoure in
his last seruyce vpon his knee, yᵉ Emperoure cōmau_n_ded hy_m_ to bere
a dysshe vnto his doughter as he was wonte to do, thynkyng hym to be
Alexander. Tho toke Lodwyke yᵉ dysshe [et] yede to yᵉ palays of the
Emperours doughter [et] salued her wᵗ grete reuerence [et] set yᵉ mete
afore her. but vnto yᵗ tyme he had not seen her she perceyued anone
yᵗ it was not Alexander, [et] sayd to hym in this manere. What is
your name, [et] whose sone are ye. [et] he answered to hyr [et] sayd,
Madame I am yᵉ kynges sone of Frau_n_ce, [et] my name is Lodwyke. She
sayd I thanke you of your laboure. [et] he toke his leue [et] departed.
In yᵉ mene tyme came Alexander to yᵉ table, [et] they fulfylled ther
seruyce. The dyner done anone Lodwyke went to his bedde sore seke. And
Alexander apperceyuynge that went to his chamber [et] sayd to hym, O my
best beloued frende [et] felowe Lodwyke how is it with you, [et] what
is yᵉ cause of your infyrmite. He answered hym and sayd, yᵉ cause of
it I knowe not but I fele me soo seke yᵗ I fere me I can not escape yᵉ
dethe. Alexander sayd yᵉ cause of your infyrmyte and dysease I knowe
well. For to daye whan as ye bare the mete vnto the Emperours doughter,
ye behelde hyr vysage [et] beaute so feruently, yᵗ your herte is taken
[et] rauysshed wᵗ her loue. Therupon he answered, O Alexander all the
physysyans in the worlde coude not more truly iuge my sekenesse, but
I fere it shall be my dethe. Then sayd Alexander, Be of good comforth
and I shall helpe you vnto my power, [et] yede vnto the market [et]
bought wᵗ his owne moneye a fayre clothe sette with precyous stones,
vnknowynge to Lodwyke [et] presented it on his behalue vnto the mayden.
[et] as she sawe yᵗ she asked hym where he myght that costely [et]
precyouse cloth fynde to bye. [et] he sayd, Madame it is the sone of
yᵉ moost crysten kynge yᵗ sendeth it vnto you for youre loue, for he
but for one syght yᵗ he hathe had of you is so seke yᵗ he lyeth vpon
his bed vnto the dethe. [et] therfore yf ye suffre hym to perysshe ye
shall neuer recouer ayen your honoure. Tho sayd she, O Alexander wolde
ye this cou_n_seyll me yᵗ I shold soo lese my vyrgynyte. God defende
that. [et] be ye sure Alexander yᵗ of suche messages ye shall neuer
more haue ne wyn thanke. Therfore go ye out of my syght [et] speke no
more therof to me. whanne Alexander herde that he dyd his obeysaunce
and departed. yᵉ nexte daye Alexander went ayen to the cyte [et] bought
a chaplet that was two tymes more in value than yᵉ cloth, and therwith
he yede to yᵉ maydens chamber [et] yaue it to hyr on the behalue of
Lodwyke. And whan she sawe that costely gyfte she sayd vnto hym in this
manere. I marueyle of you yᵗ soo oftentymes as ye haue seen and spoken
with me, that ye haue not done your owne erande or spoken for your
selfe but for an other. Then he answered, O madame I haue not ben so
disposed, by cause that my byrthe is not to be compared with yours. And
also it happened me neuer suche a case that my herte was so wounded,
[et] he yᵗ hathe a gode felawe is bou_n_de for to doo hym good [et]
true felysshyp. And therfore moost eccellent pryncesse of youre moost
habundau_n_te pyte haue compassyon vpon hym [et] make hym hole that
ye haue se wou_n_ded vnto yᵉ deth that it be not for euer layde vnto
your crueltee [et] impyteouse herte. She answered hym, go your wayes
for at this tyme I wyll gyue you none answere therof. And as he herde
yᵗ he toke his leue [et] departed. And the thyrde daye he wente vnto
the market [et] boughte a gyrdell yᵗ thre tymes was more in value [et]
costelyer than the chaplet was, [et] presented it vnto her on the
behalue of Lodwyke. And whan she sawe [et] behelde yᵗ so precyouse, she
sayd vnto Alexander, Saye to Lodwyke yᵗ he come to my chamber aboute
yᵉ thyrde hour in yᵉ nyght, and he shall fynde yᵉ dore open. [et]
Alexander herynge that, he was glad, [et] went to his felow and sayd,
My beste beloued felowe be ye of gode comforth, for I haue conquered yᵉ
mayden vnto you, and in this nyght I shall brynge you vnto hyr chamber.
And whan yᵗ was sayd, he stert vp as thoughe that he hadde wakened
out of his slepe, [et] was well reuyued [et] for grete ioye he was
made all hole. And yᵉ next nyght folowynge Alexander toke Lodwyke [et]
brought hym vnto the chamber of yᵉ lady wᵗ whome he was in solace [et]
joye all the nyght, [et] fro yᵗ tyme forth all hyr herte was vpon hym
so yᵗ there was but one loue betwyxt them bothe. And after yᵗ Lodwyke
vsed her oftentymes to vysyte. So yᵗ it came by processe of tyme to
the eres of yᵉ knyghtes of ye courte, how yᵗ the Emperours doughter
was knowen by Lodwyke: [et] conspyred amonges them selfe how yᵗ they
myght hym therwith all fynde, [et] hym to take or sle. As Alexander had
knowlege therof, he armed hym to withstande them. And whan the knyghtes
vnderstode yᵗ they ferynge Alexander suffred his felowe to go in peas,
[et] Alexander many tymes put hym selfe in ieopardye for hym, he not
knowynge therof, but yᵉ mayde knewe it welle. In shorte tyme after yᵗ
there came letters to Alexander of the dethe of the kynge of Egypt yᵗ
he sholde hastely come and receyue his kyngdome with honour [et] joye,
and that shewed he anone too the mayden and to Lodwyke. and also of his
departynge, wherof they were sorowfull [et] heuy. he sayd also vnto yᵉ
emperour, My mooste redoubted lorde please it you for to vnderstande
that I haue receyued letters of the deth of my fader. Wherfore it
behoueth me to go [et] receyue yᵉ kyngdome, and that ye wyll lycence
me to depart, and for all benefetes to [me] done I offre my selfe [et]
all my godes, [et] rather then I sholde by my goynge awaye offende or
dysplese you my lorde I shall forsake all my realme [et] all yᵗ I haue
in yᵉ world, [et] abyde wᵗ you styll. Then sayd yᵉ Emperoure, knowe ye
for certayne yᵗ of your departynge I am ryght heuy for ye were vnto
me the beste seruau_n_t that was in all my house. But it becometh
not an Emperoure to lette his seruauntes frome ther promocyons, or
auau_n_cementes, but soner to promote theym vnto hygher [et] gretter
honoure. Therfore go ye vnto oure tresourer, [et] he shall delyuer
you as moche golde as ye wyll haue, [et] in yᵉ name of god [et] with
my blessynge go in to your cou_n_tre. and thus Alexander had leue of
yᵉ Emperoure [et] bad farewell, [et] many of yᵉ courte were sorowfull
of his departynge, for of all he was beloued. Lodwyke wᵗ the mayden
brought hym on his waye well seuen myle. After that Alexander wolde not
suffre theym for to go further. then fell they both to yᵉ grou_n_de for
grete sorow [et] Alexander toke [et] lyfte them bothe vp ayen from yᵉ
erthe, [et] comforted theym with fayre [et] swete wordes and sayd, O
Lodwyke my moost beloued felawe, I warne you yᵗ the secretes beynge
betwyxt you [et] my lady, ye hyde them [et] kepe them as preuely as ye
may [et] take good hede to all thynges, for I wote an other shall come
and be in my stede, that shall enuy you of the fauoure [et] grace, yᵗ
ye stande in wᵗ the Emperoure and daye [et] nyght shall lye in a wayte
to take you wᵗ a faute, [et] to put you to a rebuke. Then answered
Lodwyke [et] sayd, O Alexander I shall be ware as moche as to me is
possyble, but how shall I nowe do whan I wante your company, therfore
one thynge I shall desyre of you yᵗ ye wyl take this rynge of me for
a reme_m_brau_n_ce. Then sayd he I shall for the loue of you gladly
receyue yᵉ rynge, [et] yet sholde I neuer wᵗoute yᵉ rynge forgete you,
[et] comytted them too god. Then they embraced eche other aboute yᵉ
necke [et] kyssed, and so departed frome other. Not longe after yᵗ
the kynges sone of Spayne named Guydo was receyued of the Emperoure
in yᵉ rowme [et] place of Alexander, to whome the stewarde assygned
Alexander's place [et] chamber, whiche was sore ayenste yᵉ wyll of
Lodwyke, but he coude not amende it. Guydo perceyuynge yᵗ Lodwyke
ayenst his wyll had hym in his felysshyp, anone he toke [et] had enuye
ayenst hym so that Lodwyke of a longe tyme for fere of ye sayd Guydo
kepte hym out of yᵉ company of yᵉ sayd mayde. Neuerthelesse afterwarde
ouercomen with the loue of yᵉ mayden, somtyme hau_n_ted [et] wente ayen
to hyr as he afore tyme had done. Guydo shortly perceyuynge awayted
so longe therupon, yᵗ he the trouthe knewe, and was therof in surete
that the mayden was by Lodwyke knowen [et] hadde accompanyed with
hym. Uppon a tyme it happened yᵗ the Emperoure stode in hys halle [et]
praysed gretely Alexander of his gentylnes and wysedome. That herynge
Guydo sayde, My lorde he is not soo moche worthy to be cōmended as ye
wene for he hath ben a longe whyle a traytour in youre house. Thenne
themperoure sayd telle me how. Guydo sayd, ye haue but one doughter
oonly, yᵉ whiche shall be your heyre, and yᵗ Lodwyke hathe defouled
[et] lyen by hyr by the helpe of Alexander: [et] he gothe to hyr euery
nyght whan it pleaseth hym. and whan yᵉ Emperoure herde yᵗ he was sore
meuyd [et] wexed angry, [et] it happened Lodwyke vpon yᵉ same tyme to
come thrugh yᵉ hall and whan the Emperour sawe hym he sayd, what hear I
of ye thou euyll and vntrue body. Yf it be founde [et] proued true thou
shalt deye yᵉ moost shamefull dethe yᵗ cann be deuysed. Lodwyke sayd,
My lorde yᵉ emperoure what is yᵉ cause. Guydo answered, I saye [et]
depose here afore my lorde ayenst the yᵗ thou haste defouled his oonly
doughter. [et] euery nyght thou goost to hyr [et] doost fornycacyon wᵗ
her, and yᵗ in batayle I shall proue [et] make good vpon thy body wᵗ
my body. Thenne sayd Lodwyke I am innocente, [et] not defectyue in yᵉ
cryme, [et] falsely yᵘ puttest yᵗ and layest vpon me, [et] therupon I
holde yᵉ batayle, for I truste on god thy falshede shall come vpon thyn
owne hede. Then yᵉ Emperoure assygned theym the daye of batayle [et]
fyghtynge. That done Lodwyke went vnto yᵉ mayden [et] shewed to her yᵉ
cause [et] the daye of batayle by the Emperoure assygned and in what
maner Guydo hadde hym accused, and sayd to hyr, Nowe it behoueth me to
haue your cou_n_seyll, or els I muste deye for why as ye knowe it had
not aueyled me to haue a-yensayd the batayle wᵗout I wolde haue yelded
myselfe gylty. Guydo is stronge [et] hardy in armes that his lyke is
none but Alexander, [et] I am weyke [et] feble [et] therfore yf I holde
the batayle ayenst hym I am but a dede man, [et] so shall ye abyde
shamed [et] rebuked. Then sayd she, Do my cou_n_seyle in that, yᵗ yᵉ
mystrust youre selfe. Go hastely vnto my fader, [et] saye to hym that
ye haue receyued letters, wherby that ye are acertayned that yᵉ lorde
your fader is sore seke [et] lyeth vppon his dede bed [et] desyreth to
se you [et] speke wᵗ youre persone, [et] to dyspose his kyngdome [et]
his godes afore he departe out of this world, [et] desyre his lycence
for the loue of your fader yᵗ ye maye go [et] vysite hym. [et] yᵗ he
wyll proroge [et] lengthe the daye of bataylle whyles yᵗ ye maye go
[et] come. And whan ye haue obteyned his congye or lycence, as hastely
as ye may go secretely to the kynge Alexander, [et] whan ye are come
to hym take hym aparte [et] shewe hym yᵉ cause of youre comynge [et]
requyre hym in this youre vtter extremyte yᵗ he wylle vs helpe [et]
ayde. And whan yᵗ Lodwyke had herd this cou_n_seyll, it pleased hym
well [et] dyde hereafter. Hys leue goten [et] lenger daye or terme of
batayle prefyxed and assygned departed [et] toke his iourneye towardes
yᵉ realme of Egypte, [et] neuer letted daye nor nyght tyll he came
vnto kynge Alexander's castell. [et] whan yᵉ kynge Alexander hadde
vnderstondynge of his comynge he was moche glad [et] went to mete hym
[et] receyued him honourably, [et] had wonder of his comyn̄ge. Tho
sayd Lodwyke, O my dere lorde [et] my bestebyloued frende, my lyfe
[et] my dethe is in youre handes, for as ye sayd to me afore yᵗ I
sholde haue an other felowe yᵉ whiche sholde lye in a wayte to aspye
me [et] too destroye me / wᵗout I save ye more wysely to my selfe:
[et] as longe as I myght I absented me tyll yᵗ I coude no lenger. But
afterwarde yᵉ kynges sone of Spayne makynge watch soo longe on me tyll
that he perceyued yᵉ trouthe, [et] hathe accused me vnto yᵉ Emperoure,
so that frome this daye vnto yᵉ viii. daye hereafter prefyxed it
behoueth me to come [et] fyght wᵗ hym body ayenst body, and as ye knowe
well he is a stronge [et] an hardy man, and I am weyke [et] feble, [et]
therfore hath Florentyne cou_n_seyled me yᵗ I sholde not hyde this
my charge frome you for she knoweth you for a faythfull frende, [et]
that ye wolde not leue vs in this necessyte. Then sayd Alexander, is
there ony body yᵗ knoweth of your comyng vnto me for this mater more
than Florentyne. He answered hym [et] sayd no creature lyuynge, for I
toke leue of yᵉ Emperoure to go [et] vysite my fader lyenge greuously
seke. Then axed Alexander hym what cou_n_seyll hathe Florentyne gyuen
to you howe [et] in what wyse I myght helpe you. He sayd, O moost
constau_n_t [et] faythfull frende, in this wyse she hath cou_n_seylled
me, co_n_syderynge yᵗ we be lyke, yᵗ ye sholde come [et] do yᵉ batayle
wyth hym, no man shall knowe you but she, and the batayll done I shall
come ayen to yᵉ court [et] ye vnto youre cou_n_tree. Then he asked whan
yᵉ day sholde be of the batayle, and he sayd this daye, viii. dayes.
Thenne sayd Alexander, yf I sholde this daye tary then can I not come
to yᵗ daye prefyxed. Therfore se what I shall do. I haue boden all my
subgectes that tomorowe they sholde come [et] be at my weddynge [et]
brydale. and yf I sholde go than is yᵗ daye loste / and yf I go not
[et] do the batayle than Florentyne [et] ye are bothe vndone. what
thynke ye nowe beste for to doo. whan Lodwyke herde yᵗ he fell to the
erthe [et] began to syghe [et] sorowe oute of mesure, saynge, sorow
and heuynesse come to me on all sydes. Then sayd Alexander vnto hym,
be of good comforte for I shall not forsake you thus, thoughe that I
sholde lese my wyf [et] kyngdome but herken what that I haue thought in
so moche as we are bothe lyke: soo yᵗ the one of vs can not be knowen
frome yᵉ other but we be bothe togyder [et] I am not yet gretly knowen
here. but my barons [et] other folke shall take you for me. Therfore
here shall ye abyde [et] tary [et] mary my wyfe in my stede, [et]
holde yᵉ feest [et] brydale, [et] do in all thynges as though I were
there my selfe present, excepte whan as ye come to bedde wᵗ my wyfe
loke yᵗ ye be there true [et] faythfull: [et] I shall wᵗoute taryenge
go [et] take my horse [et] ryde theder as yᵉ batayle shall be, [et]
yf god gyue me the vyctorye yᵗ I may ouercome [et] vaynquysshe your
enemye, I shall come ayen secretlye, and ye shall go ageyne to youre
partyes and dwellynge playce. Thys done, Alexander badde Lodwyke fare
well, and toke his journeye towardes yᵉ Emperours courte, for to fyght
and to do the batayle with Guydo. [et] Lodwyke abode in Egypt in the
stede of kynge Alexander, and vpon the next mornynge came Lodwyke as
though it hadde be kynge Alexander. [et] solemply in yᵉ face of the
chirche maryed and spoused Alexander's wyfe, [et] helde yᵉ feest and
brydale wᵗ grete royalte of delycate, [et] precyous metes, plente of
all maner wynes, [et] dyuerse melodyes of instrumentes of musyke,
and he made greate joye [et] chere to all the noble men, [et] to all
other people yᵗ there was assembled. And whan yᵉ nyghte was come, he
wente to bedde with yᵉ quene, [et] layd betwyxt hym and her a naked
swerde, wherof she had greate wonder, but no thynge she sayd, and
also he laye wᵗ hir euery nyght as longe as Alexander was out. ¶ The
kynge Alexander at the daye yᵗ was prefixed [et] sette, came vnto yᵉ
Emperoure [et] sayd, O most drad souerayne lorde it is so yᵗ I haue
left my fader ryght seke. Neuerthelesse I am come for to defende myn
honoure [et] my forwarde to performe. The Emperoure sayd ye do ryght
well [et] accordynge to a noble man, [et] fortune shall fauoure you in
your iuste [et] ryght wysse quarell. And whan the Emperours doughter
vnderstode yᵗ Alexander was comen, anone she sent for him [et] whan
as he was come to hyr she embraced hym, [et] with ioye [et] gladnesse
she kyste hym, [et] blessed yᵉ tyme that she myght see hym ayen [et]
demau_n_ded hym where he that hadde lefte hyr frende and louer Lodwyke.
Then he shewed [et] declared vnto hyr all yᵉ processe [et] how he had
left hym kyng in his realme, [et] toke his leue at hyr, [et] wente in
to Lodwyke's chamber, [et] there was no creature yᵗ thought otherwyse
but it was lodwyke, oonly excepte Florentyne. The next daye folowynge
afore er Alexander went vnto yᵉ batayle he sayd vnto yᵉ Emperoure in
yᵉ presence of Guydo. My moost redoubted souerayne lord this Guydo
hath falsely [et] vntruely accused me vnto your noble grace, yᵗ I
sholde be of suche aqueyntau_n_ce wᵗ youre doughter yᵗ sholde be vnto
yᵉ dyshonoure of your moost noble persone [et] hyrs, [et] vnto yᵗ I
swere [et] afferme, by this holy euau_n_gelyes yᵗ she was neuer in
ony maner by me in suche wyse knowen as he hathe to you alledged [et]
enformed, [et] that this daye wᵗ the ayde [et] yᵉ helpe of god I shall
proue [et] make good vppon his body. Then sayd Guydo, yet ones I say
ayen [et] swere by yᵉ holy euaungelyes [et] by all yᵗ god hathe made
yᵗ thou hast hadde knowledge [et] hast defouled yᵉ Emperours doughter,
[et] yᵗ I shall make good vpon thy hede. where vpon they lepte vpon
theyr coursers, [et] fyersly ranne togyder wᵗ theyr speres yᵗ they
bothe brake [et] shyuered in peces, [et] theye drewe theyr swerdes
[et] faught longe togyder, tylle at yᵉ laste Alexander wᵗ grete myght
and strengthe at one stroke smote of Guydoes hede, and sent it vnto
yᵉ Emperour's doughter wherof she was ryght gladde, [et] bare it vnto
her fader [et] sayd, Fader beholde the hede of hym yᵗ you [et] me hath
falsely defamed. whan yᵗ the Emperoure perceyued yᵉ vyctory, anone he
sent for Alexander whom yᵗ he beleued hadde ben Lodwyke [et] sayd,
O Lodwyke this daye youre honoure [et] my doughters ye haue saued.
ye shall stande [et] be the more in my grace [et] fauour, [et] what
soeuer he be that hereafter more defame you he shall for euer stande
in my indygnacyon. Alexander answerd, god helpethe [et] saueth theym
yᵗ trusteth in hym, [et] alwayes wreketh yᵉ blode vndeffectyue or
innocent. But now my moost redoubted lorde of one thynge I requyre you,
at my departynge fro my fader I lefte hym sore seke yᵗ it wyll lyke
you for to lycence me to go [et] se how it standethe wᵗ hym, [et] yf
yᵗ it be ony thynge amended I shall incontynent come ayen. Then the
Emperour sayd, that pleaseth me well, but ye maye in no manere wyse
leue me for fro hensforth I can not be without your presence. Alexander
toke leue of yᵉ Emperoure and bad hym fare well, [et] rode ayen vnto
his realme whome whan Lodwyke sawe he made greate chere [et] gladnesse,
[et] ryghte frendlye receyued hym [et] sayd, O moste true frende of
all frendes, tell me howe ye haue done [et] spedd in your iourney [et]
nede, and what ende ye haue brought it to. Then sayd he, goo to yᵉ
Emperoure and serue hym as ye haue done tofore. I haue goten you more
grace and fauoure of hym than euer ye haue hadde afore tyme [et] I
haue also smyten of the hede of youre enmye and aduersarye. Then sayd
Lodwyke, ye haue not only at this tyme saued my lyfe, but many a tymes
here afore, yᵉ whiche as yet I can not deserue, but god rewarde you,
[et] so departed [et] wente ayen vnto the Emperoure, [et] there was no
man that knewe of the absence of Alexander saue oonly Lodwyke. And whan
as the nyght was come he wente to bedde with the quene, [et] anone he
hadde with hyr swete [et] frendly wordes [et] her embraced [et] kyst.
Tho sayd she, ye haue made this tyme all to longe, that ye haue not
shewed ony thyng of frendshyp or loue, how may this be. Thenne sayd
he, wherfore saye ye that. She sayd, euery nyght as I was in my bed ye
haue layde betwyxe you [et] me a naked swerde and ye haue neuer tasted
or torned you towardes me more than nowe. And whan the kynge herde yᵗ
he thought on yᵉ trouthe of hys felowe [et] sayd vnto hyr, O my moost
dere lady [et] quene, it was not do[ne] for none euyll wyll, but for a
gode probacōn [et] for a perpetuall loue. But she thought in her selfe
yᵗ loue shall ye neuer more haue of me, but yᵗ dyspyte she thought I
shall auenge vpon the. Tho was there a knyght yᵗ she afore had a lytell
loue and fauour vnto, [et] she began for to loue hym more [et] more,
so longe tyll at yᵉ laste they thoughte [et] ymagyned how they myght
destroye [et] sle yᵉ kyng, [et] therfor they gate poyson [et] poysoned
yᵉ kynge, soo yᵗ yf he had not ben ryght stronge of complexyon he had
deyed thereof but it wrought in hym so sore yᵗ it caused hym to be yᵉ
moost foule and horryble lepre or laser yᵗ euer was sene vpon erthe.
The lordes [et] noble men of his realme [et] the quene also seynge this
despysed hym [et] sayd, yᵗ it behoued not a lepre to regne vpon vs, for
he sholde not procure nor engendre ony fayre or clene heyres. And so
he was deposed of yᵉ dygnyte royall, [et] dryuen out of his realme. ¶
In the meane tyme deyed the Emperour of Rome, [et] Lodwyke wedded yᵉ
doughter [et] after that Lodwyke's fader deyed, so that Lodwyke reygned
bothe Emperoure [et] kynge of Fraunce at ones. Whan kynge Alexander
herde that he thought in hymselfe, nowe my felowe reygneth togyder
vpo_n_ thempyre [et] the realme of Frau_n_ce, to whome maye I better
goo than to hym for whome many tymes I haue aduentured my lyfe. and
vpon a nyght he rose vp [et] made hym redy [et] toke wᵗ hym hys staff
[et] claper, [et] yede towarde themperours courte. And whan he was come
nyghe to yᵉ yate, he set hym amonges other lasers abydynge yᵉ gyuynge
of yᵉ almesse. and on a season as yᵉ Emperoure went out of his palays,
all yᵉ pore lasers began to rynge theyr clapers, [et] yᵉ gode kynge
Alexander dyd lyke yᵉ other, but there was none almesse gyuen to them.
He taryed so longe vnto yᵉ tyme yᵗ themperour was set [et] serued at
yᵉ table. Tho went kynge Alexander vnto yᵉ yate [et] knocked therat,
[et] the porter asked who was there. Alexander answerd hy_m_ I am a
pore despysed man, but for yᵉ loue of god I require you yᵗ ye torne
not your syght fro my vysage, and yᵗ ye wyll for yᵉ rewarde of god do
my message vnto yᵉ Emperour. he asked what is yᵉ mater. Alexander sayd
go [et] tell hym here is a laser that ryght horryble is to see. The
whiche prayeth hym for the loue of god [et] kynge Alexander that he
wyll grau_n_te hy_m_ this daye to ete his almesse afore hym vpon the
erthe in his hall. The porter sayd I wonder that ye dare desyre that
of my lorde, for why all the hall is full of lordes [et] noble me_n_,
[et] yf they beholde you they sholde all abhorre [et] leue theyr mete.
But for so moche as ye haue requyred me so profou_n_dly for yᵉ loue
of god I shall go [et] do youre erande what so euer happen therof.
[et] so he yede forthe afore themperour [et] dyd his message. Whan yᵉ
Emperour herde yᵉ porter name Alexander yᵉ kynge of Egypte, he sayd to
yᵉ porter, go bryng hym in afore me how horryble yᵗ so euer his vysage
be, [et] ordeyne hym a place afore me, yᵗ he may ete his mete afore
me in my presence. The porter brought hym in anone, [et] ordeyned hym
a place [et] set hym to mete afore yᵉ Emperour, [et] whan he was well
refresshed he sayd vnto one of the Emperours seruau_n_tes, My dere
frende do me thys erande to yᵉ Emperoure. Saye vnto hym yᵗ I praye hym
for yᵉ loue of god [et] kynge Alexander yᵗ he wylle sende me his cuppe
wᵗ wyne. The seruau_n_t sayd for yᵉ loue of god I shall doo it, but I
beleue it wyll not be, for yf ye ones drynke of my lordes cuppe, he
wyll no more drynke of yᵉ same. neuerthelesse he dyd yᵉ erande. Anone
as the Emperoure herde hym name kynge Alexander, he cōmaunded his cuppe
to be fylled of the beste wyne [et] bere it vnto hym. The whiche wyne
wha_n_ he hadde receyued it he put it into hys botelle, [et] toke his
rynge yᵗ Lodwyke had gyuen vnto hym [et] put it in to the cuppe, [et]
sent it ayen vnto yᵉ Emperour, and whan yᵉ Emperoure sawe the rynge
anone he knew it yᵗ it was the same yᵗ he had gyuen vnto Alexander in
frendeshyp whan yᵗ he departed fro hym, [et] thoughte in his herte
yᵗ Alexander is dede, or ellys this man is merueylously come vnto yᵉ
rynge, [et] cōmau_n_ded anone that the laser sholde not departe vnto
yᵉ tyme he had spoken wᵗ hym, for in no wyse he coude haue knowlege of
hym nor yet reputed hym for Alexander, after that the dyner was done
[et] ended, the Emperoure toke the seke man aparte and askyd howe he
came by yᵉ rynge. Alexander demau_n_ded yf he knewe well yᵉ rynge. The
Emperour sayd, I knowe it ryght well. Alexander sayd, wote ye also to
whome ye haue gyuen it. Themperour sayd I wote ryght well. Howe is it
than sayd Alexander yᵗ ye knowe not me, for I am Alexander to whome ye
haue gyuen yᵉ same rynge. whan the Emperoure herde yᵗ he felle downe to
the grou_n_de for sorowe [et] tare and rente his robys [et] clothes,
[et] wᵗ grete syghynges and bewaylynges sayd, O Alexander ye be the
one halfe of my soule, whehe (_sic_) is your goodlye and delycate body
yᵗ was so fayre yᵗ nowe so vnclene [et] wretchedly is enfecte. he
answered, This is me hapned for the grete fydelyte that ye haue done
to me in my bedde with my wyfe, whan ye layd a naked swerde betwyxt
you [et] hyr, wherfore she became wrothe [et] hated me, that she [et]
a knyght that afore tyme she ought hir loue vnto haue impoysened me as
ye maye see. [et] aboue yᵗ they haue dryuen me out of my realme. [et]
whan the Emperoure herde that he for loue toke hym aboute yᵉ necke [et]
kyste hym [et] sayd, O my moost entyerlye beloued brother, I sorowe to
see you in this grete syknesse [et] mysery, wolde god I myght deye for
you, but my moost dere frende, suffre pacyently a lytell tyme tyll yᵗ
we haue sente for all yᵉ physycyens [et] wyse maysters in physyke to
haue theyr counseylle [et] aduyse. yf there be ony remedye or hope of
recouerynge of your helthe, [et] yf it be possyble for to helpe you, we
shall neyther spare Empyre lordshyps nor other good temporall to make
you hole [et] sou_n_de. In the meane whyle he was brought into a fayre
chamber rychely appareylled [et] appoynted of all maner thynges yᵗ were
requysyte [et] necessarye for his ease [et] helthe. [et] in all haste
he sente his messangers by all partyes of yᵉ worlde, for yᵉ experte
[et] moost wyse physycyens yᵗ myght be fou_n_de. Of whome within a
moneth were come [et] assembled before yᵉ Emperoure xxx. yᵉ whiche
were ryght experte [et] subtyll in yᵉ scyence. To whome themperour
sayd, My welbeloued maysters I haue a frende yᵗ greuousely is infecte
wᵗ a lepry, whome I wolde ryght fayne were heled [et] made sou_n_de.
[et] no thynge theron to spare neyther golde ne syluer ne all yᵉ other
goodes yᵗ I haue in this worlde, but I wolde gyue it to recouer hys
helthe. The maysters answered [et] sayd all yᵗ euer is possyble to be
done by physyke yᵗ ye shall sone vnderstande after yᵗ we haue seen the
persone. [et] forthwᵗ as they had seen hym, [et] perceyued yᵉ cause
[et] mater of yᵉ infyrmyte, they iuged it a dysease vncurable for all
yᵉ maysters lyuynge. and whan the Emperoure herde yᵗ he was ryght sory
in hys herte, [et] remytted it vnto yᵉ helpe of almyghty god callynge
vnto hym relygyous men, [et] poore people, [et] other deuoute persones
[et] desyred theym to praye to god, yᵗ he wolde wouchesaufe to make
hole his frende yᵉ sooner for theyr gode dedes [et] prayers. and he
hymselfe with manye other fasted [et] prayed humbly to almyghty god
for yᵉ helth of his frende. Uppon a daye as kynge Alexander was in
his prayers, there came vnto hym a voyce saynge Yf the Emperoure wyll
wᵗ his owne handes slee hys two sones, whiche his wyfe hathe born by
hym at one burden, [et] wasshe thy body wᵗ the blode of them, thy body
[et] thy flesshe shall be as fayre [et] as clene as yᵉ flessh of the
lytell chyldern. whan kynge Alexander had herde this he thought in
hymselfe, this vysyon is not expedyente to be shewed for it is sore
ayenste nature yᵗ ony man sholde slee his owne sones for yᵉ recoueryng
of the helthe of a strau_n_ge man. The Emperour nyght [et] daye laye
in his prayers wᵗ greate deuocyon, [et] prayed to god for yᵉ remedye
of kynge Alexander. So yᵗ at the laste there came a voyce vnto hym
[et] sayd, how longe shall ye thus crye [et] calle vpon me whanne it
is openly shewed [et] notefyed vnto Alexander how that he shall be
made hole. The Emperoure herynge that wente vnto Alexander [et] sayd,
Of all frendes yᵉ beste [et] mooste true, blessed be the moost hyghe
god the whyche neuer faylethe yᵗ call [et] truste vpon hym, of whome I
haue knowlege yᵗ it is shewed vnto you howe [et] in what wyse that ye
maye be made hole, wherfore I praye you that ye wyll it openly shewe
vnto me that we maye joye togyder. [et] yf ye nede ony thynge therto
that I maye do I shall fulfyll it vnto my powere and for your helthe
gyue all yᵗ I haue. Alexander said Syr I dare not shewe to you how yᵗ
I maye be cured or heled of my maladye, for it excedethe [et] it is a
thynge ayenste nature for to be done, therfore I wyll not shewe it to
you, howe be it grete truste [et] confydence is in you. The Emperoure
sayde Alexander truste in me, for what so euer is possyble for to be
done for the recouerynge of youre helthe I shall do it [et] therfore
hyde no thynge frome me. Then sayd Alexander I haue of god knowlege yᵗ
yf ye wyll slee youre two sones with youre owne handes [et] wasshe me
in theyre blode I sholde be hole, [et] therfore I haue not shewed it
vnto you, for me thynketh it is ayenst nature yᵗ the fader sholde slewe
his owne chyldern for yᵉ helthe of a straunge man. The Emperoure sayd
saye not yᵗ ye be a straunge man, for I loue you as I do my selfe, [et]
therfore yf I hadde ten chyldern I sholde notte spare one alyue to haue
youre helthe. after that yᵉ Emperoure watched [et] spyed his tyme whan
yᵉ Empresse [et] all ladyes [et] chambereres were oute of yᵉ waye [et]
whan tyme was he entred into yᵉ chamber where as the chyldern slepte,
[et] drewe out his knyfe [et] cutte asonder bothe theyr throtes, [et]
gadred yᵉ blode in a vessell, [et] therin he bathed [et] wasshed
Alexander. [et] whan he was so bathed his body [et] flesshe was as
fayre [et] as clene as thought (_sic_) it had ben of a yonge chylde.
Then yᵉ emperour had knowlege of his vysage, [et] kyssed hym say_n_g,
O good Alexander nowe I see you in yᵉ same forme whiche I haue often
tymes dylected in, blessed be god that euer I hadde thyse chyldern, by
ye whome ye be holpen and made hole. [et] yet wyste no man of the deth
of yᵉ chyldern saue oonly yᵉ emperoure [et] Alexander. [et] whan as
the emperoure sawe yᵗ Alexander was parfytly heled, he sayd vnto hym,
I shall ordeyne to you an honeste companye [et] ye shall go frome hens
ten myle the next daye sende vnto me a messager, [et] yᵗ ye shew openly
vnto me of youre comynge, and I shall then with all solempnyte come
[et] mete you, [et] ye shall abyde with me vnto the tyme that we maye
otherwyse prouyde for yᵉ recouerynge of youre realme. This cou_n_seyll
pleased Alexander ryght well, [et] accordynge to yᵉ same it was done,
for on yᵉ nexte daye came yᵉ messager vnto the emperoure shewynge hym
yᵉ comynge of kynge Alexander [et] whanne the empresse herde that she
was ryghte gladde, [et] sayd vnto the emperoure, O my lorde haue ye
not nowe a cause of greate ioye, that kyng Alexander whome we of a
longe tyme haue not seen. and yf it please you to go and mete hym with
your lordes and seruau_n_tes, I shall folowe you with my ladyes [et]
gentylwymen. [et] yet wyste she not the dethe of hyr chyldern. Then
rode they forth with a grete companye and met with the kynge Alexander
and whan they mette togyder, with greate reuerence and honoure they
receyued hym, and with grete gladnesse and joye they broughte hym in
to the palays. and whanne the tyme of dyner was come Alexander was set
at yᵉ table betwyxt yᵉ emperour [et] yᵉ empresse [et] all the chere yᵗ
she coude make she dyd to hym. and whan the Emperour perceyued that,
he was ryghte well pleased [et] sayd, O myne owne Florentyne I joye
aboue all thynges yᵗ ye do [et] make to kynge Alexander soo gode chere.
Then sayd she, wherfore sholde I not, is not his comynge to vs bothe
joye [et] gladnesse but more to you my lorde, for this dygnyte yᵗ ye
are in by hym ye are promoted, [et] many tymes he hathe saued you fro
yᵉ dethe. Themperour sayd than I praye you myn owne Florentyne yᵗ ye
wyll take hede to my wordes yᵗ I shall saye to you. Sawe ye not yᵉ
foule laser, whiche the laste daye sate before oure table, and prayed
me for the loue of god [et] kynge Alexander yᵗ I shold gyue hym drynke.
she sayd, My lorde I saw hym well a more horryble man I neuer behelde.
then sayd Themperoure, I demaunde nowe this of you. I put case yᵗ he
were kynge Alexander [et] that he in ony wyse coude not be made hole
but wᵗ the blood of your sones, the whiche ye in one daye brought in
to this worlde, wolde ye not yᵗ theyr bloode were shed that he myght
bathe hym therin to yᵉ entente yᵗ by the same he myght haue parfyte
helthe as ye nowe se hym in. She sayd my lorde wherfore demau_n_de ye
me yᵗ question. I saye [et] lete you haue knowlege for trouthe that
yf I hadde ten sones I sholde gladly slee them wᵗ min owne handes to
prepare [et] ordeyne for hym a bayne, [et] sholde wasshe hym therin
myne owne selfe, rather than I sholde leue hym in suche peryll. for
god myght well sende vs mo chyldern. but suche a true frende were as
a thynge impossyble for vs to recouer or fynde. Whan themperour herde
this of hyr, he was well co_n_tente [et] pleased in his mynde [et]
sayd, O wyfe had ye leuer haue your chyldern dede than Alexander shold
be in yᵗ sekenesse of lepery. therfore shall I open and shewe to you
nowe yᵉ trouthe of yᵉ mater. That foule laser the whiche ye sawe was
Alexander that syttethe here, [et] by yᵗ maner he is made hole wᵗ the
blode of our sones, [et] they are dede: as yᵉ Empresse herde yᵗ she
began to sorowe as nature wolde, all thoughe she had sayd afore yᵗ
she had leuer see hyr chyldern dede than she wolde suffre Alexander
in suche payne. The nourysshes of yᵉ chyldern vnderstandynge this,
wᵗ grete cryenge [et] wepynge went to yᵉ nourysshery or chamber of

ayen in all haste vnto yᵉ Emperour [et] shewed hym yᵗ his sones were

gladnesse in all yᵉ courte, [et] gaue thankynges vnto al[m]yghty god
[et] to yᵉ blessed vyrgyne mary his moder of yᵗ grete myracle. after
yᵗ themperoure wᵗ a grete multytude and company of people gadred [et]
assembled went wᵗ Alexander into Egypte [et] set hym ayen into his
royalte [et] possessyon of his Realme [et] the quene wᵗ the knyghte
whiche lyued togyder in auoutry he dyd the_m_ both to be brent in too

wysely [et] manly gouerned hymselfe in all his feates [et] actes so yᵗ
he ouercame all his enmyes [et] rebelles. And whan he was in al his
glorye, peas [et] myght, he hadde thought [et] mynde vpon his fader
[et] moder, by whome he was caste into the see, which dwelled in ferre
partyes from thens he sent to them a messager [et] dyd them to haue
knowelege yᵗ the kynge of Egypte vpon suche a daye wolde be wᵗ them to

to hym gyue_n_ sent hym ayen, saynge yᵗ theyr seruyces sholde be redy
at all tymes to do yᵉ kynge plesure but yᵗ coude they neuer by power
fully deserue yᵗ he wolde wouchesauf to shewe them yᵗ honoure, wherto
they were not worthy, he for to come to them to ete [et] to drynke

towarde his faders house, yᵉ whiche as well to yᵉ knyght his fader as
to his moder was vnknowen that he was theyr sone. Whanne the kynge was
come nygh vnto his faders castell, the knyght rode to receyue and mete
hym, [et] whan he come nyghe vnto yᵉ kynge he descended frome his horse
[et] reuerenced hym with his knee on the erthe, but the kynge toke hym
vp shortly, [et] comau_n_ded hym to ascende ayen vpon his horse, [et]
rode so togyder cheke by cheke vnto yᵉ castell. And whan they were
come theder the moder came them to mete, [et] felle vpon hyr knees to

kyssed hyr ryght frendly. [et] she sayd, My moost honorable lorde ye
do vnto vs vnworthy grete honour wᵗ the presence of your persone moost
honourable, the whiche we neuer more can deserue. After yᵗ all the mete
was all redy, [et] the tyme of yᵉ day was come to go to dyner. The
fader came wᵗ a basyn, [et] with an ewyr, [et] the moder wᵗ a towell
saynge, Syre all thynge is redye, please it you to wasshe. [et] whan yᵉ
kyng sawe that he smyled [et] sayd vnto hymselfe, Nowe is yᵉ songe of
the nyghtyngale true, for my fader [et] my moder sholde gladly fulfyll
as I sayd, yf yᵗ I my selfe wolde therto consente and suffre them to
do it. But he wold not suffre theym for to doo too hym suche seruyce,
saynge youre aege is for to be honoured and worshypped / [et] therfore
I wyll not of it, and called vnto hym one of his seruauntes the whiche
serued hym therof. Thenne sayd the knyght, ye wyll not suffre vs too do
it for our honour, for we are not worthy therto. The kynge sayd, haue
not I sayd that for your aege I forbere you it. whan yᵉ kynge was set
at yᵉ table, he set his moder on yᵉ ryght hande of hym, [et] his fader
on his lefte syde [et] they as moche as they myght behelde his vysage
[et] cou_n_tenau_n_ce. The dyner ended yᵉ kynge entred in to a chamber,
[et] made yᵉ knyght wᵗ his lady to come in to hym, [et] comau_n_ded all
other to auoyde [et] goo out. and whan they were thus alone, yᵉ kynge
sayd vnto them haue ye no chyldern. They answerd we haue neyther sone
ne doughter. and yᵉ kynge sayd had ye neuer none. The knyght answered,
we haue hadde one sone, but he is longe agone dede. The kynge asked
of what dethe deyed he. The knyghte sayd, a naturall dethe: Tho sayd
yᵉ kynge, yf I maye otherwyse knowe yᵗ he deyed than are yᵉ fou_n_de
wᵗ a defawte. Tho asked the knyghte, My lorde wherfore enquyre ye thus
after oure sone. The kynge answered, that do I not wᵗout cause, [et]
therfore I wyll knowe of what dethe he deyed. [et] yf ye wyll not tell
me I shall cause you to deye a shamefull dethe. whan they herde that
they fell too grou_n_de upon ther knees afore hym [et] asked hym mercye
[et] forgyuenesse of theyr lyues. The kynge wolde not suffre them to
knele, but scortly toke them vp [et] sayd, To that entente came I not
in to your house to ete your brede [et] to betraye you. but saye me
yᵉ trouthe [et] ye shall be saued, for it is gyuen me to vndesta_n_de
that ye haue put hym to dethe, and yf that come in iugemente ye muste
deye a shamefull dethe. Than sayd the knyght, lorde pardone me my lyfe
[et] I shall shew you yᵉ very trouthe. The kynge sayd fere not, for I
shall do you no harme. Tho sayd he, Souerayne lorde we had a sone oonly
yᵗ was wyse [et] lettred [et] ryght well vnderstande. And vpon a tyme
as he stode afore vs [et] serued at yᵉ table, There came a nyghtyngale
yᵗ ryght swetly songe, whoos songe he began to interprete and tell
vs what it mente [et] sayd: This byrde syngeth that I shall become
so grete [et] myghty a lorde yᵗ it shall be to youre honoure [et]
aduau_n_seme_n_t in suche wyse yᵗ ye my fader shall be gladde to holde
yᵉ basyn wᵗ water to wasshe in my handes, [et] my moder yᵉ towell yf yᵗ
I wolde suffre it. And whan I herde yᵗ I was sore meued [et] toke [et]
caste hym in to yᵉ see for too drowne. Tho sayd the kynge what euyll
myght haue come to you yf he hadd ben made so grete [et] myghty, me
thynketh it sholde haue been youre honoure [et] proufyte. The knyghte
sayd lorde it was no reason but a woodnesse. The kynge answered: yᵗ was
a grete folysshnes of you yᵗ yᵉ wolde do ayenst yᵉ ordynau_n_ce [et]
wylle of god. But nowe ye shall knowe for trouth yᵗ I am youre sone
yᵗ ye caste in to yᵉ see. [et] god of his grete mercye [et] goodnesse
hathe saued me, [et] by his grace hathe brought me too this astate
[et] dygnyte. and yᵉ fader [et] moder herynge yᵗ with fere [et] joye
replenysshed fell flat to yᵉ grou_n_de, whom he louy_n_ly [et] frendly
toke vp sayng fere not, but rather be glad [et] joyous for ye shall
no thynge suffre, but my exaltacyon shall be your glorye [et] joye
[et] proufyte [et] kyste bothe his fader [et] moder wᵗ grete joye [et]
gladnesse. Tho began yᵉ meder (_sic_) to wepe. Than sayd yᵉ kynge wepe
not but be of gode chere for in my realme yᵉ shall be honoured aboue
me durynge my lyf [et] toke them wᵗ hym in to his realme where they
dwelled togyder in honour [et] joye, [et] ended theyr dayes wᵗ joye
[et] myrthe.

_Here foloweth yᵉ applycacōn of yᵉ example to purpose._


T[h]enne sayd the Emperours sone, lorde haue ye vnderstande what I
haue sayd. Themperoure sayd ryght well. Tho sayd the sone, My mooste
honourable [et] redoubted fader, all thoughe yᵗ god hathe gyuen [et]
indued me wᵗ wysdome [et] vnderstandyng aboue many other, yᵗ sholde
not be in appayrynge of youre honoure [et] myght, but more for the
preseruacyon of the same. So in lyke wyse yᵉ kynges maieste which was
no thynge to yᵉ hynderaunce of his fader, but rather for his worshyp
[et] proufyte, for as long as they lyued they were honoured in his
realme. Than sayd themperoure, My dere sone I wyll all hole resygne to
you thempyre too gouerne, for I perceyue well by youre narracōn yᵗ ye
haue to me declared, yᵗ it is beste to me [et] moost for myn ease yᵗ
I leue this besynesse [et] labour [et] take me to more reste, for I
am olde [et] feeble. The sone answered his fader, My lorde fader, so
shall it not be, but as longe as ye lyue ye shall haue the auctoryte
and myght of thempyre to do and commaunde as it apperteyneth vnto an
Emperour, but in all besynesses yᵗ are labourouse I wyll alwayes be
redy to mynystre [et] to serue you accordynge to my dute.




[How Judgement was given upon the Empress and how that she and her
Lover were both put to death.


[Then the Emperor commanded the judges and justices to sit in judgement
and to bring again the Empress before them; with the Ladies and also
the Ribauld, her best beloved, cloathed in the vesture and habit of
a woman, whom he did cause to stand next unto the Empress; then the
Emperor's son asked sentence and just judgement upon them, saying,

[My most honourable Lord and father, even as you are Emperour of the
World; and that your majesty and power requireth to do true justice
unto all your subjects that desire it: so now I demand that you this
day do give right sentence and true judgement upon the untruth,
falshood and shame which were put and alledged unto me by the Empress;
for the which accusations I have been seven times led unto the gallows
and have stood in great jeopardy and peril of my life; and also that
she hath been to you untrue of her body as you have seen by good proof
made before you; and on the which I ask judgement; and therefore
command your Justices and Judges to give sentence thereupon, according
to Right, Equity and Law.

[As soon as the Empress heard this, she fell flat to the earth before
the Emperor and asked mercy and forgiveness for her just offence and
misdoing; but it helped nor profited nothing, for the son would have
right and desired Judgement. Then spake the Judges and Justices, her
own misdeeds condemn her, and the report of her Lemmon by her kept and
found; therefore we give sentence against the Empress, that she shall
be bound to a horses tail and drawn through all the streets of the city
to the place] of execucyon [et] there to be brent. [et] we iuge also
[et] gyue sentence ayenste the rybaude yᵗ he shall be quartred [et]
smyten in peces [et] his flesshe caste vnto yᵉ houndes, and byrdes of
yᵉ ayre for to deuoure hym, [et] this se_n_tence was approbate [et]
alowed of all people. ¶ Hereafter in shorte tyme deyed yᵉ Emperoure,
[et] Dyoclesyan his sone gouerned [et] ruled thempyre wᵗ grete wysdome,
[et] helde [et] kept his maysters wᵗ hym in grete honoure [et] glorye.
By whoos cou_n_seyll [et] wysdom he gouerned the Empyre, yᵗ he excelled
all his predecessours in rychesse [et] in doynge iustice [et] ryght.
And his maysters loued hym aboue all other thynges in the worlde. So
that many tymes they put themselfe in grete perylle [et] ieoperdye of
ther lyues for hym. And so they ended theyr dayes in grete joye [et]
honoure, and cōmended theym to almyghty god.

¶ Thus endeth the treatyse of the seuen sages or wyse maysters of Rome.
